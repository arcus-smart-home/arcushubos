<title>Yocto Project Concepts</title>

    <para>
        This chapter provides explanations for Yocto Project concepts that
        go beyond the surface of "how-to" information and reference (or
        look-up) material.
        Concepts such as components, the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
        workflow, cross-development toolchains, shared state cache, and so
        forth are explained.

        <para>
            BitBake handles the parsing and execution of the data files.
            The data itself is of various types:

        <para>
            BitBake knows how to combine multiple data sources together and
            refers to each data source as a layer.
            For information on layers, see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#understanding-and-creating-layers'>Understanding and Creating Layers</ulink>"
            section of the Yocto Project Development Tasks Manual.
        </para>

        <para>
            Following are some brief details on these core components.
            For additional information on how these components interact during
            a build, see the
            "<link linkend='openembedded-build-system-build-concepts'>OpenEmbedded Build System Concepts</link>"

            <title>BitBake</title>

            <para>
                BitBake is the tool at the heart of the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
                and is responsible for parsing the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>,
                generating a list of tasks from it, and then executing those
                tasks.
            </para>

            <para>
                This section briefly introduces BitBake.
                If you want more information on BitBake, see the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;'>BitBake User Manual</ulink>.
            </para>

            <para>
                To see a list of the options BitBake supports, use either of
                the following commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -h
     $ bitbake --help
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The most common usage for BitBake is
                <filename>bitbake <replaceable>packagename</replaceable></filename>,
                where <filename>packagename</filename> is the name of the
                package you want to build (referred to as the "target").
                The target often equates to the first part of a recipe's
                filename (e.g. "foo" for a recipe named
                <filename>foo_1.3.0-r0.bb</filename>).
                So, to process the
                <filename>matchbox-desktop_1.2.3.bb</filename> recipe file, you
                might type the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop
                </literallayout>
                Several different versions of
                <filename>matchbox-desktop</filename> might exist.
                BitBake chooses the one selected by the distribution
                configuration.
                You can get more details about how BitBake chooses between
                different target versions and providers in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#bb-bitbake-preferences'>Preferences</ulink>"
                section of the BitBake User Manual.
            </para>

            <para>
                BitBake also tries to execute any dependent tasks first.
                So for example, before building
                <filename>matchbox-desktop</filename>, BitBake would build a
                cross compiler and <filename>glibc</filename> if they had not
                already been built.
            </para>

            <para>
                A useful BitBake option to consider is the
                <filename>-k</filename> or <filename>--continue</filename>
                option.
                This option instructs BitBake to try and continue processing
                the job as long as possible even after encountering an error.
                When an error occurs, the target that failed and those that
                depend on it cannot be remade.
                However, when you use this option other dependencies can
                still be processed.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='overview-components-recipes'>
            <title>Recipes</title>

            <para>
                Files that have the <filename>.bb</filename> suffix are
                "recipes" files.
                In general, a recipe contains information about a single piece
                of software.
                This information includes the location from which to download
                the unaltered source, any source patches to be applied to that
                source (if needed), which special configuration options to
                apply, how to compile the source files, and how to package the
                compiled output.
            </para>

            <para>
                The term "package" is sometimes used to refer to recipes.
                However, since the word "package" is used for the packaged
                output from the OpenEmbedded build system (i.e.
                <filename>.ipk</filename> or <filename>.deb</filename> files),
                this document avoids using the term "package" when referring
                to recipes.

        <section id='overview-components-classes'>
            <title>Classes</title>

            <para>
                Class files (<filename>.bbclass</filename>) contain information
                that is useful to share between recipes files.
                An example is the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-autotools'><filename>autotools</filename></ulink>
                class, which contains common settings for any application that
                Autotools uses.
                The
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes'>Classes</ulink>"
                chapter in the Yocto Project Reference Manual provides
                details about classes and how to use them.

        <section id='overview-components-configurations'>
            <title>Configurations</title>

            <para>
                The configuration files (<filename>.conf</filename>) define
                various configuration variables that govern the OpenEmbedded
                build process.
                These files fall into several areas that define machine
                configuration options, distribution configuration options,
                compiler tuning options, general common configuration options,
                and user configuration options in
                <filename>conf/local.conf</filename>, which is found in the

    <section id='overview-layers'>
        <title>Layers</title>

        <para>
            Layers are repositories that contain related metadata (i.e.
            sets of instructions) that tell the OpenEmbedded build system how
            to build a target.
            Yocto Project's
            <link linkend='the-yocto-project-layer-model'>layer model</link>
            facilitates collaboration, sharing, customization, and reuse
            within the Yocto Project development environment.
            Layers logically separate information for your project.
            For example, you can use a layer to hold all the configurations
            for a particular piece of hardware.
            Isolating hardware-specific configurations allows you to share
            other metadata by using a different layer where that metadata
            might be common across several pieces of hardware.
        </para>

        <para>
            Many layers exist that work in the Yocto Project development
            environment.
            The
            <ulink url='https://caffelli-staging.yoctoproject.org/software-overview/layers/'>Yocto Project Curated Layer Index</ulink>
            and
            <ulink url='http://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/'>OpenEmbedded Layer Index</ulink>
            both contain layers from which you can use or leverage.
        </para>

        <para>
            By convention, layers in the Yocto Project follow a specific form.
            Conforming to a known structure allows BitBake to make assumptions
            during builds on where to find types of metadata.
            You can find procedures and learn about tools (i.e.
            <filename>bitbake-layers</filename>) for creating layers suitable
            for the Yocto Project in the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#understanding-and-creating-layers'>Understanding and Creating Layers</ulink>"

            <para>
                User configuration helps define the build.
                Through user configuration, you can tell BitBake the
                target architecture for which you are building the image,
                where to store downloaded source, and other build properties.

            <para>
                BitBake needs some basic configuration files in order to
                complete a build.
                These files are <filename>*.conf</filename> files.
                The minimally necessary ones reside as example files in the
                <filename>build/conf</filename> directory of the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>.
                For simplicity, this section refers to the Source Directory as
                the "Poky Directory."
            </para>

            <para>
                When you clone the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#poky'>Poky</ulink>
                Git repository or you download and unpack a Yocto Project
                release, you can set up the Source Directory to be named
                anything you want.
                For this discussion, the cloned repository uses the default
                name <filename>poky</filename>.
                <note>
                    The Poky repository is primarily an aggregation of existing
                    repositories.
                    It is not a canonical upstream source.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                The <filename>meta-poky</filename> layer inside Poky contains
                a <filename>conf</filename> directory that has example
                configuration files.
                These example files are used as a basis for creating actual
                configuration files when you source
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-core-script'><filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename></ulink>,
                which is the build environment script.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sourcing the build environment script creates a
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
                if one does not already exist.
                BitBake uses the Build Directory for all its work during
                builds.
                The Build Directory has a <filename>conf</filename> directory
                that contains default versions of your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> and
                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> configuration files.
                These default configuration files are created only if versions

                Because the Poky repository is fundamentally an aggregation of
                existing repositories, some users might be familiar with
                running the <filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename> script
                in the context of separate
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#oe-core'>OpenEmbedded-Core</ulink>
                and BitBake repositories rather than a single Poky repository.
                This discussion assumes the script is executed from
                within a cloned or unpacked version of Poky.

                Depending on where the script is sourced, different
                sub-scripts are called to set up the Build Directory
                (Yocto or OpenEmbedded).
                Specifically, the script
                <filename>scripts/oe-setup-builddir</filename> inside the
                poky directory sets up the Build Directory and seeds the
                directory (if necessary) with configuration files appropriate
                for the Yocto Project development environment.
                <note>
                    The <filename>scripts/oe-setup-builddir</filename> script
                    uses the <filename>$TEMPLATECONF</filename> variable to
                    determine which sample configuration files to locate.

                The <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file tells BitBake what
                layers you want considered during the build.
                By default, the layers listed in this file include layers
                minimally needed by the build system.
                However, you must manually add any custom layers you have
                created.
                You can find more information on working with the
                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#enabling-your-layer'>Enabling Your Layer</ulink>"

                The files <filename>site.conf</filename> and
                <filename>auto.conf</filename> are not created by the
                environment initialization script.
                If you want the <filename>site.conf</filename> file, you
                need to create that yourself.
                The <filename>auto.conf</filename> file is typically created by
                an autobuilder:
                <itemizedlist>

                        <emphasis><filename>site.conf</filename>:</emphasis>
                        You can use the <filename>conf/site.conf</filename>
                        configuration file to configure multiple
                        build directories.
                        For example, suppose you had several build environments
                        and they shared some common features.
                        You can set these default build properties here.
                        A good example is perhaps the packaging format to use
                        through the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES'><filename>PACKAGE_CLASSES</filename></ulink>
                        variable.</para>

                        <para>One useful scenario for using the
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename> file is to extend
                        your
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBPATH'><filename>BBPATH</filename></ulink>
                        variable to include the path to a
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename>.
                        Then, when BitBake looks for Metadata using
                        <filename>BBPATH</filename>, it finds the
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename> file and applies
                        your common configurations found in the file.
                        To override configurations in a particular build
                        directory, alter the similar configurations within
                        that build directory's
                        <filename>conf/local.conf</filename> file.

                        The settings put into the file are typically the

                You can edit all configuration files to further define
                any particular build environment.
                This process is represented by the "User Configuration Edits"

            <para>
                When you launch your build with the
                <filename>bitbake <replaceable>target</replaceable></filename>
                command, BitBake sorts out the configurations to ultimately
                define your build environment.
                It is important to understand that the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
                reads the configuration files in a specific order:
                <filename>site.conf</filename>, <filename>auto.conf</filename>,
                and <filename>local.conf</filename>.
                And, the build system applies the normal assignment statement
                rules as described in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#bitbake-user-manual-metadata'>Syntax and Operators</ulink>"
                chapter of the BitBake User Manual.
                Because the files are parsed in a specific order, variable
                assignments for the same variable could be affected.
                For example, if the <filename>auto.conf</filename> file and
                the <filename>local.conf</filename> set
                <replaceable>variable1</replaceable> to different values,
                because the build system parses <filename>local.conf</filename>
                after <filename>auto.conf</filename>,
                <replaceable>variable1</replaceable> is assigned the value from
                the <filename>local.conf</filename> file.

                This section takes a closer look at the layers the build system

                In general, all layers have a similar structure.
                They all contain a licensing file
                (e.g. <filename>COPYING.MIT</filename>) if the layer is to be
                distributed, a <filename>README</filename> file as good
                practice and especially if the layer is to be distributed, a

                areas where many layers that work with the Yocto Project
                exist.
                The
                <ulink url="http://git.yoctoproject.org/">Source Repositories</ulink>
                also shows layers categorized under "Yocto Metadata Layers."
                <note>
                    Layers exist in the Yocto Project Source Repositories that
                    cannot be found in the OpenEmbedded Layer Index.
                    These layers are either deprecated or experimental
                    in nature.

                    The distribution layer provides policy configurations for
                    your distribution.
                    Best practices dictate that you isolate these types of
                    configurations into their own layer.
                    Settings you provide in
                    <filename>conf/distro/<replaceable>distro</replaceable>.conf</filename> override
                    similar settings that BitBake finds in your

                    The BSP Layer provides machine configurations that
                    target specific hardware.
                    Everything in this layer is specific to the machine for

                        In order for a BSP layer to be considered compliant

            <title>Sources</title>

            <para>
                In order for the OpenEmbedded build system to create an
                image or any target, it must be able to access source files.
                The
                <link linkend='general-workflow-figure'>general workflow figure</link>
                represents source files using the "Upstream Project Releases",
                "Local Projects", and "SCMs (optional)" boxes.
                The figure represents mirrors, which also play a role in
                locating source files, with the "Source Materials" box.
            </para>

            <para>
                The method by which source files are ultimately organized is
                a function of the project.
                For example, for released software, projects tend to use
                tarballs or other archived files that can capture the
                state of a release guaranteeing that it is statically
                represented.
                On the other hand, for a project that is more dynamic or
                experimental in nature, a project might keep source files in a
                repository controlled by a Source Control Manager (SCM) such as
                Git.
                Pulling source from a repository allows you to control
                the point in the repository (the revision) from which you
                want to build software.
                Finally, a combination of the two might exist, which would
                give the consumer a choice when deciding where to get
                source files.
            </para>

            <para>
                BitBake uses the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                variable to point to source files regardless of their location.
                Each recipe must have a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable
                that points to the source.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another area that plays a significant role in where source
                files come from is pointed to by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                This area is a cache that can hold previously downloaded
                source.
                You can also instruct the OpenEmbedded build system to create
                tarballs from Git repositories, which is not the default
                behavior, and store them in the <filename>DL_DIR</filename>
                by using the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS'><filename>BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS</filename></ulink>
                variable.
            </para>

            <para>
                Judicious use of a <filename>DL_DIR</filename> directory can
                save the build system a trip across the Internet when looking
                for files.
                A good method for using a download directory is to have
                <filename>DL_DIR</filename> point to an area outside of your
                Build Directory.
                Doing so allows you to safely delete the Build Directory
                if needed without fear of removing any downloaded source file.

                    Upstream project releases exist anywhere in the form of an
                    archived file (e.g. tarball or zip file).
                    These files correspond to individual recipes.
                    For example, the figure uses specific releases each for
                    BusyBox, Qt, and Dbus.
                    An archive file can be for any released product that can be

                    Local projects are custom bits of software the user
                    provides.
                    These bits reside somewhere local to a project - perhaps
                    a directory into which the user checks in items (e.g.
                    a local directory containing a development source tree

                    variables point to these, respectively.
                    BitBake checks pre-mirrors before looking upstream for any
                    source files.
                    Pre-mirrors are appropriate when you have a shared

            <para>
                When the OpenEmbedded build system generates an image or an
                SDK, it gets the packages from a package feed area located
                in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.

                <link linkend='general-workflow-figure'>general workflow figure</link>

                This section looks a little closer into the package feeds
                area used by the build system.
                Here is a more detailed look at the area:
                <imagedata fileref="figures/package-feeds.png" align="center" width="7in" depth="6in" />
            </para>

            <para>
                Package feeds are an intermediary step in the build process.
                The OpenEmbedded build system provides classes to generate
                different package types, and you specify which classes to
                enable through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES'><filename>PACKAGE_CLASSES</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Before placing the packages into package feeds,
                the build process validates them with generated output quality
                assurance checks through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-insane'><filename>insane</filename></ulink>
                class.
            </para>

            <para>
                The package feed area resides in the Build Directory.
                The directory the build system uses to temporarily store
                packages is determined by a combination of variables and the
                particular package manager in use.
                See the "Package Feeds" box in the illustration and note the
                information to the right of that area.
                In particular, the following defines where package files are
                kept:

                    You can use <filename>SRC_URI</filename> parameters to

                    BitBake finds and applies multiple patches for a single
                    recipe in the order in which it locates the patches.
                    The <filename>FILESPATH</filename> variable defines the
                    default set of directories that the build system uses to
                    search for patch files.
                    Once found, patches are applied to the recipe's source
                    files, which are located in the

                    After source code is patched, BitBake executes tasks that
                    configure and compile the source code.
                    Once compilation occurs, the files are copied to a holding
                    area (staged) in preparation for packaging:

                    Analysis involves the following as well as other items:

                    Depending on the type of packages being created (RPM, DEB,

                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package_write_deb'><filename>do_package_write_*</filename></ulink>
                    task creates the actual packages and places them in the
                    Package Feed area, which is
                    <filename>${TMPDIR}/deploy</filename>.

                    <note>
                        Support for creating feeds directly from the
                        <filename>deploy/*</filename> directories does not
                        exist.
                        Creating such feeds usually requires some kind of feed
                        maintenance mechanism that would upload the new
                        packages into an official package feed (e.g. the
                        Ångström distribution).
                        This functionality is highly distribution-specific
                        and thus is not provided out of the box.

                    Once packages are split and stored in the Package Feeds
                    area, the build system uses BitBake to generate the root
                    filesystem image:

                    The image generation process consists of several stages and

                <para>
                    Package installation is under control of the package
                    manager (e.g. dnf/rpm, opkg, or apt/dpkg) regardless of
                    whether or not package management is enabled for the
                    target.
                    At the end of the process, if package management is not
                    enabled for the target, the package manager's data files
                    are deleted from the root filesystem.
                    As part of the final stage of package installation,
                    post installation scripts that are part of the packages
                    are run.
                    Any scripts that fail to run on the build host are run on
                    the target when the target system is first booted.

                    The final stages of the <filename>do_rootfs</filename> task

                    The manifest file (<filename>.manifest</filename>) resides

                    This file lists out, line-by-line, the installed packages.
                    The manifest file is useful for the

                    class, for example, to determine whether or not to run

                <para>
                    Optimizing processes that are run across the image include

                    The <filename>mklibs</filename> process optimizes the size

                    process optimizes the dynamic linking of shared libraries
                    to reduce start up time of executables.

                <para>
                    After the root filesystem is built, processing begins on
                    the image through the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-image'><filename>do_image</filename></ulink>
                    task.
                    The build system runs any pre-processing commands as
                    defined by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND'><filename>IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                    This variable specifies a list of functions to call before
                    the build system creates the final image output files.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The build system dynamically creates
                    <filename>do_image_*</filename> tasks as needed, based
                    on the image types specified in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FSTYPES'><filename>IMAGE_FSTYPES</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                    The process turns everything into an image file or a set of
                    image files and can compress the root filesystem image to
                    reduce the overall size of the image.
                    The formats used for the root filesystem depend on the
                    <filename>IMAGE_FSTYPES</filename> variable.
                    Compression depends on whether the formats support
                    compression.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As an example, a dynamically created task when creating a
                    particular image <replaceable>type</replaceable> would
                    take the following form:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     do_image_<replaceable>type</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    So, if the <replaceable>type</replaceable> as specified by
                    the <filename>IMAGE_FSTYPES</filename> were
                    <filename>ext4</filename>, the dynamically generated task
                    would be as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     do_image_ext4
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    The final task involved in image creation is the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-image-complete'><filename>do_image_complete</filename></ulink>
                    task.
                    This task completes the image by applying any image
                    post processing as defined through the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND'><filename>IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                    The variable specifies a list of functions to call once the
                    build system has created the final image output files.
                    <note>
                        The entire image generation process is run under

                        Running under Pseudo ensures that the files in the

                    Like image generation, the SDK script process consists of

                    The <filename>do_populate_sdk</filename> task helps create
                    the standard SDK and handles two parts: a target part and a
                    host part.
                    The target part is the part built for the target hardware
                    and includes libraries and headers.
                    The host part is the part of the SDK that runs on the

                <title>Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks</title>

                <para>
                    For each task that completes successfully, BitBake writes a
                    stamp file into the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-STAMPS_DIR'><filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename></ulink>
                    directory.
                    The beginning of the stamp file's filename is determined
                    by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-STAMP'><filename>STAMP</filename></ulink>
                    variable, and the end of the name consists of the task's
                    name and current
                    <link linkend='overview-checksums'>input checksum</link>.
                    <note>
                        This naming scheme assumes that
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER'><filename>BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER</filename></ulink>
                        is "OEBasicHash", which is almost always the case in
                        current OpenEmbedded.
                    </note>
                    To determine if a task needs to be rerun, BitBake checks
                    if a stamp file with a matching input checksum exists
                    for the task.
                    If such a stamp file exists, the task's output is
                    assumed to exist and still be valid.
                    If the file does not exist, the task is rerun.
                    <note>
                        <para>The stamp mechanism is more general than the
                        shared state (sstate) cache mechanism described in the
                        "<link linkend='setscene-tasks-and-shared-state'>Setscene Tasks and Shared State</link>"
                        section.
                        BitBake avoids rerunning any task that has a valid
                        stamp file, not just tasks that can be accelerated
                        through the sstate cache.</para>

                        <para>However, you should realize that stamp files only
                        serve as a marker that some work has been done and that
                        these files do not record task output.
                        The actual task output would usually be somewhere in
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TMPDIR'><filename>TMPDIR</filename></ulink>
                        (e.g. in some recipe's
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.)
                        What the sstate cache mechanism adds is a way to cache
                        task output that can then be shared between build
                        machines.</para>
                    </note>
                    Since <filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename> is usually a
                    subdirectory of <filename>TMPDIR</filename>, removing
                    <filename>TMPDIR</filename> will also remove
                    <filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename>, which means tasks will
                    properly be rerun to repopulate
                    <filename>TMPDIR</filename>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you want some task to always be considered "out of
                    date", you can mark it with the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#variable-flags'><filename>nostamp</filename></ulink>
                    varflag.
                    If some other task depends on such a task, then that
                    task will also always be considered out of date, which
                    might not be what you want.

                    The description of tasks so far assumes that BitBake needs
                    to build everything and no available prebuilt objects
                    exist.
                    BitBake does support skipping tasks if prebuilt objects are
                    available.
                    These objects are usually made available in the form of a
                    shared state (sstate) cache.
                    <note>
                        For information on variables affecting sstate, see the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SSTATE_DIR'><filename>SSTATE_DIR</filename></ulink>

                <para>
                    The idea of a setscene task (i.e
                    <filename>do_</filename><replaceable>taskname</replaceable><filename>_setscene</filename>)
                    is a version of the task where
                    instead of building something, BitBake can skip to the end
                    result and simply place a set of files into specific
                    locations as needed.
                    In some cases, it makes sense to have a setscene task
                    variant (e.g. generating package files in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package_write_deb'><filename>do_package_write_*</filename></ulink>
                    task).
                    In other cases, it does not make sense (e.g. a
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-patch'><filename>do_patch</filename></ulink>
                    task or a
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-unpack'><filename>do_unpack</filename></ulink>
                    task) since the work involved would be equal to or greater
                    than the underlying task.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In the build system, the common tasks that have setscene
                    variants are
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>,
                    <filename>do_package_write_*</filename>,
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-deploy'><filename>do_deploy</filename></ulink>,
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-packagedata'><filename>do_packagedata</filename></ulink>,
                    and
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-populate_sysroot'><filename>do_populate_sysroot</filename></ulink>.
                    Notice that these tasks represent most of the tasks whose
                    output is an end result.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The build system has knowledge of the relationship between
                    these tasks and other preceding tasks.
                    For example, if BitBake runs
                    <filename>do_populate_sysroot_setscene</filename> for
                    something, it does not make sense to run any of the
                    <filename>do_fetch</filename>,
                    <filename>do_unpack</filename>,
                    <filename>do_patch</filename>,
                    <filename>do_configure</filename>,
                    <filename>do_compile</filename>, and
                    <filename>do_install</filename> tasks.
                    However, if <filename>do_package</filename> needs to be
                    run, BitBake needs to run those other tasks.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It becomes more complicated if everything can come
                    from an sstate cache because some objects are simply
                    not required at all.
                    For example, you do not need a compiler or native tools,
                    such as quilt, if nothing exists to compile or patch.
                    If the <filename>do_package_write_*</filename> packages
                    are available from sstate, BitBake does not need the
                    <filename>do_package</filename> task data.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To handle all these complexities, BitBake runs in two
                    phases.
                    The first is the "setscene" stage.
                    During this stage, BitBake first checks the sstate cache
                    for any targets it is planning to build.
                    BitBake does a fast check to see if the object exists
                    rather than a complete download.
                    If nothing exists, the second phase, which is the setscene
                    stage, completes and the main build proceeds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If objects are found in the sstate cache, the build system
                    works backwards from the end targets specified by the user.
                    For example, if an image is being built, the build system
                    first looks for the packages needed for that image and the
                    tools needed to construct an image.
                    If those are available, the compiler is not needed.
                    Thus, the compiler is not even downloaded.
                    If something was found to be unavailable, or the
                    download or setscene task fails, the build system then
                    tries to install dependencies, such as the compiler, from
                    the cache.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The availability of objects in the sstate cache is
                    handled by the function specified by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION'><filename>BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION</filename></ulink>
                    variable and returns a list of available objects.
                    The function specified by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_SETSCENE_DEPVALID'><filename>BB_SETSCENE_DEPVALID</filename></ulink>
                    variable is the function that determines whether a given
                    dependency needs to be followed, and whether for any given
                    relationship the function needs to be passed.
                    The function returns a True or False value.

                the output labeled "Application Development SDK" represents an
                SDK.
                The SDK generation process differs depending on whether you
                build an extensible SDK (e.g.
                <filename>bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext</filename> <replaceable>imagename</replaceable>)
                or a standard SDK (e.g.
                <filename>bitbake -c populate_sdk</filename> <replaceable>imagename</replaceable>).
                This section takes a closer look at this output:
                <imagedata fileref="figures/sdk.png" align="center" width="9in" depth="7.25in" />
            </para>

            <para>
                The specific form of this output is a set of files that
                includes a self-extracting SDK installer
                (<filename>*.sh</filename>), host and target manifest files,
                and files used for SDK testing.
                When the SDK installer file is run, it installs the SDK.
                The SDK consists of a cross-development toolchain, a set of
                libraries and headers, and an SDK environment setup script.
                Running this installer essentially sets up your
                cross-development environment.
                You can think of the cross-toolchain as the "host"
                part because it runs on the SDK machine.
                You can think of the libraries and headers as the "target"
                part because they are built for the target hardware.
                The environment setup script is added so that you can
                initialize the environment before using the tools.

            The Yocto Project does most of the work for you when it comes to
            creating
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#cross-development-toolchain'>cross-development toolchains</ulink>.
            This section provides some technical background on how
            cross-development toolchains are created and used.
            For more information on toolchains, you can also see the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_SDK_URL;'>Yocto Project Application Development and the Extensible Software Development Kit (eSDK)</ulink>
            manual.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the Yocto Project development environment, cross-development
            toolchains are used to build images and applications that run
            on the target hardware.
            With just a few commands, the OpenEmbedded build system creates
            these necessary toolchains for you.
        </para>

        <para>
            The following figure shows a high-level build environment regarding
            toolchain construction and use.

        </para>

        <para>
            Most of the work occurs on the Build Host.
            This is the machine used to build images and generally work within
            the the Yocto Project environment.
            When you run
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            to create an image, the OpenEmbedded build system
            uses the host <filename>gcc</filename> compiler to bootstrap a
            cross-compiler named <filename>gcc-cross</filename>.
            The <filename>gcc-cross</filename> compiler is what BitBake uses to
            compile source files when creating the target image.
            You can think of <filename>gcc-cross</filename> simply as an
            automatically generated cross-compiler that is used internally
            within BitBake only.
            <note>
                The extensible SDK does not use
                <filename>gcc-cross-canadian</filename> since this SDK
                ships a copy of the OpenEmbedded build system and the sysroot
                within it contains <filename>gcc-cross</filename>.

            You can use the OpenEmbedded build system to build an installer for
            the relocatable SDK used to develop applications.
            When you run the installer, it installs the toolchain, which
            contains the development tools (e.g.,
            <filename>gcc-cross-canadian</filename>,
            <filename>binutils-cross-canadian</filename>, and other
            <filename>nativesdk-*</filename> tools),
            which are tools native to the SDK (i.e. native to
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SDK_ARCH'><filename>SDK_ARCH</filename></ulink>),
            you need to cross-compile and test your software.
            The figure shows the commands you use to easily build out this

            which might or might not be the same

                If your target architecture is supported by the Yocto Project,
                you can take advantage of pre-built images that ship with the

            By design, the OpenEmbedded build system builds everything from
            scratch unless
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            can determine that parts do not need to be rebuilt.
            Fundamentally, building from scratch is attractive as it means all
            parts are built fresh and no possibility of stale data exists that
            can cause problems.
            When developers hit problems, they typically default back to
            building from scratch so they have a know state from the
            start.
        </para>

        <para>
            Building an image from scratch is both an advantage and a
            disadvantage to the process.
            As mentioned in the previous paragraph, building from scratch
            ensures that everything is current and starts from a known state.
            However, building from scratch also takes much longer as it
            generally means rebuilding things that do not necessarily need
            to be rebuilt.

            The Yocto Project implements shared state code that supports
            incremental builds.
            The implementation of the shared state code answers the following
            questions that were fundamental roadblocks within the OpenEmbedded
            incremental build support system:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>
                    What pieces of the system have changed and what pieces have

                    </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            For the first question, the build system detects changes in the
            "inputs" to a given task by creating a checksum (or signature) of
            the task's inputs.
            If the checksum changes, the system assumes the inputs have changed
            and the task needs to be rerun.
            For the second question, the shared state (sstate) code tracks
            which tasks add which output to the build process.
            This means the output from a given task can be removed, upgraded
            or otherwise manipulated.
            The third question is partly addressed by the solution for the
            second question assuming the build system can fetch the sstate
            objects from remote locations and install them if they are deemed
            to be valid.

            <para>
                When determining what parts of the system need to be built,
                BitBake works on a per-task basis rather than a per-recipe
                basis.
                You might wonder why using a per-task basis is preferred over
                a per-recipe basis.
                To help explain, consider having the IPK packaging backend
                enabled and then switching to DEB.
                In this case, the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                and
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>
                task outputs are still valid.
                However, with a per-recipe approach, the build would not
                include the <filename>.deb</filename> files.
                Consequently, you would have to invalidate the whole build and
                rerun it.
                Rerunning everything is not the best solution.
                Also, in this case, the core must be "taught" much about
                specific tasks.
                This methodology does not scale well and does not allow users
                to easily add new tasks in layers or as external recipes
                without touching the packaged-staging core.

        <section id='overview-checksums'>
            <title>Checksums (Signatures)</title>

            <para>
                The shared state code uses a checksum, which is a unique
                signature of a task's inputs, to determine if a task needs to
                be run again.
                Because it is a change in a task's inputs that triggers a
                rerun, the process needs to detect all the inputs to a given
                task.
                For shell tasks, this turns out to be fairly easy because
                the build process generates a "run" shell script for each task
                and it is possible to create a checksum that gives you a good
                idea of when the task's data changes.
            </para>

            <para>
                To complicate the problem, there are things that should not be
                included in the checksum.
                First, there is the actual specific build path of a given
                task - the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.
                It does not matter if the work directory changes because it
                should not affect the output for target packages.
                Also, the build process has the objective of making native
                or cross packages relocatable.
                <note>
                    Both native and cross packages run on the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#hardware-build-system-term'>build host</ulink>.
                    However, cross packages generate output for the target
                    architecture.
                </note>
                The checksum therefore needs to exclude
                <filename>WORKDIR</filename>.
                The simplistic approach for excluding the work directory is to
                set <filename>WORKDIR</filename> to some fixed value and
                create the checksum for the "run" script.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another problem results from the "run" scripts containing
                functions that might or might not get called.
                The incremental build solution contains code that figures out
                dependencies between shell functions.
                This code is used to prune the "run" scripts down to the
                minimum set, thereby alleviating this problem and making the
                "run" scripts much more readable as a bonus.
            </para>

            <para>
                So far, solutions for shell scripts exist.
                What about Python tasks?
                The same approach applies even though these tasks are more
                difficult.
                The process needs to figure out what variables a Python
                function accesses and what functions it calls.
                Again, the incremental build solution contains code that first
                figures out the variable and function dependencies, and then
                creates a checksum for the data used as the input to the task.
            </para>

            <para>
                Like the <filename>WORKDIR</filename> case, situations exist
                where dependencies should be ignored.
                For these situations, you can instruct the build process to
                ignore a dependency by using a line like the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardepsexclude] = "MACHINE"
                </literallayout>
                This example ensures that the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_ARCHS'><filename>PACKAGE_ARCHS</filename></ulink>
                variable does not depend on the value of
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-MACHINE'><filename>MACHINE</filename></ulink>,
                even if it does reference it.
            </para>

            <para>
                Equally, there are cases where you need to add dependencies
                BitBake is not able to find.
                You can accomplish this by using a line like the following:

                This example explicitly adds the <filename>MACHINE</filename>

                As an example, consider a case with in-line Python where
                BitBake is not able to figure out dependencies.
                When running in debug mode (i.e. using
                <filename>-DDD</filename>), BitBake produces output when it
                discovers something for which it cannot figure out dependencies.
                The Yocto Project team has currently not managed to cover
                those dependencies in detail and is aware of the need to fix
                this situation.

                Thus far, this section has limited discussion to the direct
                inputs into a task.
                Information based on direct inputs is referred to as the
                "basehash" in the code.
                However, the question of a task's indirect inputs still
                exits - items already built and present in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.
                The checksum (or signature) for a particular task needs to add
                the hashes of all the tasks on which the particular task
                depends.
                Choosing which dependencies to add is a policy decision.
                However, the effect is to generate a master checksum that
                combines the basehash and the hashes of the task's
                dependencies.
            </para>

            <para>
                At the code level, a variety of ways exist by which both the
                basehash and the dependent task hashes can be influenced.
                Within the BitBake configuration file, you can give BitBake
                some extra information to help it construct the basehash.
                The following statement effectively results in a list of
                global variable dependency excludes (i.e. variables never
                included in any checksum):
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST ?= "TMPDIR FILE PATH PWD BB_TASKHASH BBPATH DL_DIR \
         SSTATE_DIR THISDIR FILESEXTRAPATHS FILE_DIRNAME HOME LOGNAME SHELL TERM \
         USER FILESPATH STAGING_DIR_HOST STAGING_DIR_TARGET COREBASE PRSERV_HOST \
         PRSERV_DUMPDIR PRSERV_DUMPFILE PRSERV_LOCKDOWN PARALLEL_MAKE \
         CCACHE_DIR EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN CCACHE CCACHE_DISABLE LICENSE_PATH SDKPKGSUFFIX"
                </literallayout>
                The previous example excludes
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>
                since that variable is actually constructed as a path within
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TMPDIR'><filename>TMPDIR</filename></ulink>,
                which is on the whitelist.
            </para>

            <para>
                The rules for deciding which hashes of dependent tasks to
                include through dependency chains are more complex and are
                generally accomplished with a Python function.
                The code in <filename>meta/lib/oe/sstatesig.py</filename> shows
                two examples of this and also illustrates how you can insert
                your own policy into the system if so desired.
                This file defines the two basic signature generators
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#oe-core'>OE-Core</ulink>
                uses:  "OEBasic" and "OEBasicHash".
                By default, a dummy "noop" signature handler is enabled
                in BitBake.
                This means that behavior is unchanged from previous versions.
                OE-Core uses the "OEBasicHash" signature handler by default
                through this setting in the <filename>bitbake.conf</filename>
                file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER ?= "OEBasicHash"
                </literallayout>
                The "OEBasicHash" <filename>BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER</filename>
                is the same as the "OEBasic" version but adds the task hash to
                the
                <link linkend='stamp-files-and-the-rerunning-of-tasks'>stamp files</link>.
                This results in any metadata change that changes the task hash,
                automatically causing the task to be run again.
                This removes the need to bump
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>
                values, and changes to metadata automatically ripple across
                the build.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is also worth noting that the end result of these
                signature generators is to make some dependency and hash
                information available to the build.

            <para>
                Checksums and dependencies, as discussed in the previous
                section, solve half the problem of supporting a shared state.
                The other half of the problem is being able to use checksum
                information during the build and being able to reuse or rebuild
                specific components.
            </para>

                The

                class is a relatively generic implementation of how to
                "capture" a snapshot of a given task.
                The idea is that the build process does not care about the
                source of a task's output.
                Output could be freshly built or it could be downloaded and
                unpacked from somewhere.
                In other words, the build process does not need to worry about
                its origin.
            </para>

            <para>
                Two types of output exist.
                One type is just about creating a directory in
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.
                A good example is the output of either
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                or
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>.
                The other type of output occurs when a set of data is merged
                into a shared directory tree such as the sysroot.

                The Yocto Project team has tried to keep the details of the

                From a user's perspective, adding shared state wrapping to a

                Behind the scenes, the shared state code works by looking in

                    The shared state directory
                    (<filename>SSTATE_DIR</filename>) is organized into
                    two-character subdirectories, where the subdirectory
                    names are based on the first two characters of the hash.
                    If the shared state directory structure for a mirror has the
                    same structure as <filename>SSTATE_DIR</filename>, you must
                    specify "PATH" as part of the URI to enable the build system
                    to map to the appropriate subdirectory.

                The shared state package validity can be detected just by
                looking at the filename since the filename contains the task
                checksum (or signature) as described earlier in this section.
                If a valid shared state package is found, the build process
                downloads it and uses it to accelerate the task.
            </para>

            <para>
                The build processes use the <filename>*_setscene</filename>
                tasks for the task acceleration phase.
                BitBake goes through this phase before the main execution
                code and tries to accelerate any tasks for which it can find
                shared state packages.
                If a shared state package for a task is available, the
                shared state package is used.
                This means the task and any tasks on which it is dependent
                are not executed.
            </para>

            <para>
                As a real world example, the aim is when building an IPK-based
                image, only the

                tasks would have their shared state packages fetched and
                extracted.
                Since the sysroot is not used, it would never get extracted.
                This is another reason why a task-based approach is preferred
                over a recipe-based approach, which would have to install the
                output from every task.

        <title>Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies</title>

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system automatically adds common types of
            runtime dependencies between packages, which means that you do not
            need to explicitly declare the packages using
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>.
            Three automatic mechanisms exist (<filename>shlibdeps</filename>,
            <filename>pcdeps</filename>, and <filename>depchains</filename>)
            that handle shared libraries, package configuration (pkg-config)
            modules, and <filename>-dev</filename> and
            <filename>-dbg</filename> packages, respectively.
            For other types of runtime dependencies, you must manually declare
            the dependencies.

                    task of each recipe, all shared libraries installed by the
                    recipe are located.
                    For each shared library, the package that contains the
                    shared library is registered as providing the shared
                    library.
                    More specifically, the package is registered as providing
                    the
                    <ulink url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname'>soname</ulink>

                    <para>Simultaneously, all executables and shared libraries
                    installed by the recipe are inspected to see what shared
                    libraries they link against.
                    For each shared library dependency that is found,
                    <filename>PKGDATA_DIR</filename> is queried to
                    see if some package (likely from a different recipe)
                    contains the shared library.
                    If such a package is found, a runtime dependency is added
                    from the package that depends on the shared library to the
                    package that contains the library.</para>

                    <para>The automatically added runtime dependency also
                    includes a version restriction.
                    This version restriction specifies that at least the
                    current version of the package that provides the shared
                    library must be used, as if
                    "<replaceable>package</replaceable> (>= <replaceable>version</replaceable>)"
                    had been added to <filename>RDEPENDS</filename>.
                    This forces an upgrade of the package containing the shared
                    library when installing the package that depends on the
                    library, if needed.</para>

                    A module is seen as depending on another module if it

        <title>Fakeroot and Pseudo</title>

        <para>
            Some tasks are easier to implement when allowed to perform certain
            operations that are normally reserved for the root user (e.g.
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>,
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package_write_deb'><filename>do_package_write*</filename></ulink>,
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-rootfs'><filename>do_rootfs</filename></ulink>,
            and
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-image'><filename>do_image*</filename></ulink>).
            For example, the <filename>do_install</filename> task benefits
            from being able to set the UID and GID of installed files to
            arbitrary values.
        </para>

        <para>
            One approach to allowing tasks to perform root-only operations
            would be to require
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            to run as root.
            However, this method is cumbersome and has security issues.
            The approach that is actually used is to run tasks that benefit
            from root privileges in a "fake" root environment.
            Within this environment, the task and its child processes believe
            that they are running as the root user, and see an internally
            consistent view of the filesystem.
            As long as generating the final output (e.g. a package or an image)
            does not require root privileges, the fact that some earlier
            steps ran in a fake root environment does not cause problems.
        </para>

        <para>
            The capability to run tasks in a fake root environment is known as
            "<ulink url='http://man.he.net/man1/fakeroot'>fakeroot</ulink>",
            which is derived from the BitBake keyword/variable
            flag that requests a fake root environment for a task.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>,
            the program that implements fakeroot is known as
            <ulink url='https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-item/pseudo/'>Pseudo</ulink>.
            Pseudo overrides system calls by using the environment variable
            <filename>LD_PRELOAD</filename>, which results in the illusion
            of running as root.
            To keep track of "fake" file ownership and permissions resulting
            from operations that require root permissions, Pseudo uses
            an SQLite 3 database.
            This database is stored in
            <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink><filename>}/pseudo/files.db</filename>
            for individual recipes.
            Storing the database in a file as opposed to in memory
            gives persistence between tasks and builds, which is not
            accomplished using fakeroot.
            <note><title>Caution</title>
                If you add your own task that manipulates the same files or
                directories as a fakeroot task, then that task also needs to
                run under fakeroot.
                Otherwise, the task cannot run root-only operations, and
                cannot see the fake file ownership and permissions set by the
                other task.
                You need to also add a dependency on
                <filename>virtual/fakeroot-native:do_populate_sysroot</filename>,
                giving the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
       fakeroot do_mytask () {
           ...
       }
       do_mytask[depends] += "virtual/fakeroot-native:do_populate_sysroot"
                </literallayout>
            </note>

            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-FAKEROOT'><filename>FAKEROOT*</filename></ulink>
