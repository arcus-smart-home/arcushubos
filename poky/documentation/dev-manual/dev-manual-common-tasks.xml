<title>Common Tasks</title>
    <para>
        This chapter describes fundamental procedures such as creating layers,
        adding new software packages, extending or customizing images,
        porting work to new hardware (adding a new machine), and so forth.
        You will find that the procedures documented here occur often in the
        development cycle using the Yocto Project.

        <title>Understanding and Creating Layers</title>

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system supports organizing
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink> into
            multiple layers.
            Layers allow you to isolate different types of customizations from
            each other.
            You might find it tempting to keep everything in one layer when
            working on a single project.
            However, the more modular your Metadata, the easier
            it is to cope with future changes.
        </para>

        <para>
            To illustrate how layers are used to keep things modular, consider
            machine customizations.
            These types of customizations typically reside in a special layer,
            rather than a general layer, called a Board Support Package (BSP)
            Layer.
            Furthermore, the machine customizations should be isolated from
            recipes and Metadata that support a new GUI environment,
            for example.
            This situation gives you a couple of layers: one for the machine
            configurations, and one for the GUI environment.
            It is important to understand, however, that the BSP layer can
            still make machine-specific additions to recipes within the GUI
            environment layer without polluting the GUI layer itself
            with those machine-specific changes.
            You can accomplish this through a recipe that is a BitBake append
            (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) file, which is described later
            in this section.
            <note>
                For general information on BSP layer structure, see the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp'>Board Support Packages (BSP) - Developer's Guide</ulink>.

            <title>Layers</title>

            <para>
                The <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
                contains both general layers and BSP
                layers right out of the box.
                You can easily identify layers that ship with a
                Yocto Project release in the Source Directory by their
                folder names.
                Folders that represent layers typically have names that begin with
                the string <filename>meta-</filename>.
                <note>
                    It is not a requirement that a layer name begin with the
                    prefix <filename>meta-</filename>, but it is a commonly
                    accepted standard in the Yocto Project community.
                </note>
                For example, when you set up the Source Directory structure,
                you will see several layers:
                <filename>meta</filename>,
                <filename>meta-skeleton</filename>,
                <filename>meta-selftest</filename>,
                <filename>meta-poky</filename>, and
                <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename>.
                Each of these folders represents a distinct layer.
            </para>

            <para>
                As another example, if you set up a local copy of the
                <filename>meta-intel</filename> Git repository
                and then explore the folder of that general layer,
                you will discover many Intel-specific BSP layers inside.
                For more information on BSP layers, see the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-layers'>BSP Layers</ulink>"
                section in the Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP)

            <para>
                It is very easy to create your own layers to use with the
                OpenEmbedded build system.
                The Yocto Project ships with scripts that speed up creating
                general layers and BSP layers.
                This section describes the steps you perform by hand to create
                a layer so that you can better understand them.
                For information about the layer-creation scripts, see the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#creating-a-new-bsp-layer-using-the-yocto-bsp-script'>Creating a New BSP Layer Using the yocto-bsp Script</ulink>"

                        Before creating a new layer, you should be sure someone
                        has not already created a layer containing the Metadata
                        you need.
                        You can see the

                        folder with the string <filename>meta-</filename>.
                        For example:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-mylayer
     meta-GUI_xyz
     meta-mymachine

                       File:</emphasis>
                       Inside your new layer folder, you need to create a
                       <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file.
                       It is easiest to take an existing layer configuration
                       file and copy that to your layer's
                       <filename>conf</filename> directory and then modify the
                       file as needed.</para>

                       <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # We have a conf and classes directory, add to BBPATH
     BBPATH .= ":${LAYERDIR}"

     # We have recipes-* directories, add to BBFILES

                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>Here is an explanation of the example:

                                <note>
                                    All non-distro layers, which include all BSP
                                    layers, are expected to append the layer
                                    directory to the
                                    <filename>BBPATH</filename>.
                                    On the other hand, distro layers, such as
                                    <filename>meta-poky</filename>, can choose
                                    to enforce their own precedence over
                                    <filename>BBPATH</filename>.
                                    For an example of that syntax, see the

                                variable then assigns a priority to the layer.

                        configuration files, and files that are included
                        with <filename>include</filename> and

                        For these cases, BitBake uses the first file that

            <title>Following Best Practices When Creating Layers</title>

            <para>
                To create layers that are easier to maintain and that will
                not impact builds for other machines, you should consider the
                information in the following list:

                        <emphasis>Avoid "Overlaying" Entire Recipes from Other Layers in Your Configuration:</emphasis>
                        In other words, do not copy an entire recipe into your
                        layer and then modify it.
                        Rather, use an append file
                        (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) to override only those
                        parts of the original recipe you need to modify.

                    <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>Avoid Duplicating Include Files:</emphasis>
                        Use append files (<filename>.bbappend</filename>)
                        for each recipe that uses an include file.
                        Or, if you are introducing a new recipe that requires
                        the included file, use the path relative to the
                        original layer directory to refer to the file.
                        For example, use

                        instead of
                        <filename>require </filename><replaceable>file</replaceable><filename>.inc</filename>.
                        If you're finding you have to overlay the include file,
                        it could indicate a deficiency in the include file in
                        the layer to which it originally belongs.
                        If this is the case, you should try to address that
                        deficiency instead of overlaying the include file.
                        For example, you could address this by getting the
                        maintainer of the include file to add a variable or
                        variables to make it easy to override the parts needing
                        to be overridden.

                        Proper use of overrides within append files and
                        placement of machine-specific files within your layer
                        can ensure that a build is not using the wrong Metadata
                        and negatively impacting a build for a different
                        machine.
                        Following are some examples:
                        <itemizedlist>
                            <listitem><para>
                                <emphasis>Modify Variables to Support a
                                Different Machine:</emphasis>
                                Suppose you have a layer named
                                <filename>meta-one</filename> that adds support
                                for building machine "one".
                                To do so, you use an append file named
                                <filename>base-files.bbappend</filename> and
                                create a dependency on "foo" by altering the
                                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEPENDS'><filename>DEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                                variable:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEPENDS = "foo"
                                </literallayout>
                                The dependency is created during any build that
                                includes the layer
                                <filename>meta-one</filename>.
                                However, you might not want this dependency
                                for all machines.
                                For example, suppose you are building for
                                machine "two" but your
                                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file has the
                                <filename>meta-one</filename> layer included.
                                During the build, the
                                <filename>base-files</filename> for machine
                                "two" will also have the dependency on
                                <filename>foo</filename>.</para>
                                <para>To make sure your changes apply only when
                                building machine "one", use a machine override
                                with the <filename>DEPENDS</filename> statement:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEPENDS_one = "foo"
                                </literallayout>
                                You should follow the same strategy when using
                                <filename>_append</filename> and
                                <filename>_prepend</filename> operations:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEPENDS_append_one = " foo"
     DEPENDS_prepend_one = "foo "
                                </literallayout>
                                As an actual example, here's a line from the recipe
                                for gnutls, which adds dependencies on
                                "argp-standalone" when building with the musl C
                                library:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEPENDS_append_libc-musl = " argp-standalone"
                                </literallayout>
                                <note>
                                    Avoiding "+=" and "=+" and using
                                    machine-specific
                                    <filename>_append</filename>
                                    and <filename>_prepend</filename> operations
                                    is recommended as well.

                                When you have a base recipe, such as

                                statement to a file, you can use an append file
                                to cause the build to use your own version of
                                the file.
                                For example, an append file in your layer at
                                <filename>meta-one/recipes-core/base-files/base-files.bbappend</filename>
                                could extend

                                as follows:

     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${BPN}:"
                                </literallayout>
                                The build for machine "one" will pick up your
                                machine-specific file as long as you have the
                                file in
                                <filename>meta-one/recipes-core/base-files/base-files/</filename>.
                                However, if you are building for a different
                                machine and the
                                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file includes
                                the <filename>meta-one</filename> layer and
                                the location of your machine-specific file is
                                the first location where that file is found
                                according to <filename>FILESPATH</filename>,
                                builds for all machines will also use that
                                machine-specific file.</para>

                                For example, rather than placing the file in

            <para>
                When you create a layer used with the Yocto Project, it is
                advantageous to make sure that the layer interacts well with
                existing Yocto Project layers (i.e. the layer is compatible
                with the Yocto Project).
                Ensuring compatibility makes the layer easy to be consumed
                by others in the Yocto Project community and could allow you
                permission to use the Yocto Project Compatible Logo.
                <note>
                    Only Yocto Project member organizations are permitted to

                    The <filename>yocto-check-layer</filename> script
                    provides you a way to assess how compatible your layer is
                    with the Yocto Project.
                    You should run this script prior to using the form to
                    apply for compatibility as described in the previous
                    section.
                    You need to achieve a "PASS" result in order to have
                    your application form successfully processed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The script divides tests into three areas: COMMON, BSD,
                    and DISTRO.
                    For example, given a distribution layer (DISTRO), the
                    layer must pass both the COMMON and DISTRO related tests.
                    Furthermore, if your layer is a BSP layer, the layer must
                    pass the COMMON and BSP set of tests.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To execute the script, enter the following commands from
                    your build directory:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ source oe-init-build-env
     $ yocto-check-layer <replaceable>your_layer_directory</replaceable>

                    Be sure to provide the actual directory for your layer
                    as part of the command.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Entering the command causes the script to determine the
                    type of layer and then to execute a set of specific
                    tests against the layer.

            <title>Enabling Your Layer</title>

            <para>
                Before the OpenEmbedded build system can use your new layer,
                you need to enable it.
                To enable your layer, simply add your layer's path to the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBLAYERS'>BBLAYERS</ulink></filename>
                variable in your <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file,
                which is found in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.
                The following example shows how to enable a layer named
                <filename>meta-mylayer</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LCONF_VERSION = "6"

     BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
     BBFILES ?= ""

     BBLAYERS ?= " \

            <para>
                BitBake parses each <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file
                as specified in the <filename>BBLAYERS</filename> variable
                within the <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file.
                During the processing of each
                <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file, BitBake adds the
                recipes, classes and configurations contained within the
                particular layer to the source directory.

            <title>Using .bbappend Files in Your Layer</title>

            <para>
                A recipe that appends Metadata to another recipe is called a
                BitBake append file.
                A BitBake append file uses the <filename>.bbappend</filename>
                file type suffix, while the corresponding recipe to which
                Metadata is being appended uses the <filename>.bb</filename>
                file type suffix.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can use a <filename>.bbappend</filename> file in your
                layer to make additions or changes to the content of another
                layer's recipe without having to copy the other layer's
                recipe into your layer.
                Your <filename>.bbappend</filename> file resides in your layer,
                while the main <filename>.bb</filename> recipe file to
                which you are appending Metadata resides in a different layer.
            </para>

            <para>
                Being able to append information to an existing recipe not only
                avoids duplication, but also automatically applies recipe
                changes from a different layer into your layer.
                If you were copying recipes, you would have to manually merge
                changes as they occur.
            </para>

            <para>
                When you create an append file, you must use the same root
                name as the corresponding recipe file.
                For example, the append file
                <filename>someapp_&DISTRO;.bbappend</filename> must apply to
                <filename>someapp_&DISTRO;.bb</filename>.
                This means the original recipe and append file names are
                version number-specific.
                If the corresponding recipe is renamed to update to a newer
                version, you must also rename and possibly update
                the corresponding <filename>.bbappend</filename> as well.
                During the build process, BitBake displays an error on starting
                if it detects a <filename>.bbappend</filename> file that does
                not have a corresponding recipe with a matching name.
                See the

            <para>
                Following is the append file, which is named
                <filename>formfactor_0.0.bbappend</filename> and is from the
                Raspberry Pi BSP Layer named
                <filename>meta-raspberrypi</filename>.
                The file is in the layer at

            <para>
                By default, the build system uses the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-FILESPATH'><filename>FILESPATH</filename></ulink>
                variable to locate files.
                This append file extends the locations by setting the

                variable.
                Setting this variable in the <filename>.bbappend</filename>
                file is the most reliable and recommended method for adding
                directories to the search path used by the build system
                to find files.
            </para>

            <para>
                The statement in this example extends the directories to
                include
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-THISDIR'><filename>THISDIR</filename></ulink><filename>}/${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>,
                which resolves to a directory named
                <filename>formfactor</filename> in the same directory
                in which the append file resides (i.e.
                <filename>meta-raspberrypi/recipes-bsp/formfactor</filename>.
                This implies that you must have the supporting directory
                structure set up that will contain any files or patches you
                will be including from the layer.

            <para>
                Using the immediate expansion assignment operator
                <filename>:=</filename> is important because of the reference
                to <filename>THISDIR</filename>.
                The trailing colon character is important as it ensures that
                items in the list remain colon-separated.
                <note>
                    <para>
                        BitBake automatically defines the
                        <filename>THISDIR</filename> variable.
                        You should never set this variable yourself.
                        Using "_prepend" as part of the
                        <filename>FILESEXTRAPATHS</filename> ensures your path
                        will be searched prior to other paths in the final

                    <para>
                        Also, not all append files add extra files.
                        Many append files simply exist to add build options
                        (e.g. <filename>systemd</filename>).
                        For these cases, your append file would not even
                        use the <filename>FILESEXTRAPATHS</filename> statement.

                Each layer is assigned a priority value.
                Priority values control which layer takes precedence if there

                For these cases, the recipe file from the layer with a higher

                You can use the BitBake layer management tool to provide a view
                into the structure of recipes across a multi-layer project.
                Being able to generate output that reports on configured layers
                with their paths and priorities and on
                <filename>.bbappend</filename> files and their applicable
                recipes can help to reveal potential problems.

                        Flattens the layer configuration into a separate output

                        Flattening your layer configuration builds a "flattened"
                        directory that contains the contents of all layers,
                        with any overlayed recipes removed and any

                        corresponding recipes.
                        You might have to perform some manual cleanup of the
                        flattened layer as follows:

                                files.

                                The contents of each
                                <filename>.bbappend</filename> end up in the
                                flattened recipe.
                                However, if there are appended or changed
                                variable values, you need to tidy these up
                                yourself.
                                Consider the following example.
                                Here, the <filename>bitbake-layers</filename>
                                command adds the line
                                <filename>#### bbappended ...</filename> so that
                                you know where the following lines originate:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ...
     DESCRIPTION = "A useful utility"
     ...
     EXTRA_OECONF = "--enable-something"
     ...

     #### bbappended from meta-anotherlayer ####

     DESCRIPTION = "Customized utility"
     EXTRA_OECONF += "--enable-somethingelse"
                                </literallayout>
                                Ideally, you would tidy up these utilities as
                                follows:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>

                        The script assumes you want to use the MIT license,
                        which is typical for most layers, for the contents of
                        the layer itself.

            <para>
                In its simplest form, you can use the following command form
                to create a layer.
                The command creates a layer whose name corresponds to
                <replaceable>your_layer_name</replaceable> in the current
                directory:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake-layers create-layer <replaceable>your_layer_name</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                If you want to set the priority of the layer to other than the
                default value of "6", you can either use the
                <filename>&dash;&dash;priority</filename> option or you can
                edit the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBFILE_PRIORITY'><filename>BBFILE_PRIORITY</filename></ulink>
                value in the <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> after the
                script creates it.
                Furthermore, if you want to give the example recipe file
                some name other than the default, you can
                use the
                <filename>&dash;&dash;example-recipe-name</filename> option.
            </para>

            <para>
                The easiest way to see how the
                <filename>bitbake-layers create-layer</filename> command
                works is to experiment with the script.
                You can also read the usage information by entering the
                following:

            <para>
                Once you create your general layer, you must add it to your
                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file.
                You can add your layer by using the
                <filename>bitbake-layers add-layer</filename> command:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake-layers add-layer <replaceable>your_layer_name</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
                Here is an example where a layer named
                <filename>meta-scottrif</filename> is added and then the
                layers are shown using the
                <filename>bitbake-layers show-layers</filename> command:

            <para>
                Probably the easiest way to customize an image is to add a
                package by way of the <filename>local.conf</filename>
                configuration file.
                Because it is limited to local use, this method generally only
                allows you to add packages and is not as flexible as creating
                your own customized image.
                When you add packages using local variables this way, you need
                to realize that these variable changes are in effect for every
                build and consequently affect all images, which might not
                be what you require.
            </para>

            <para>
                To add a package to your image using the local configuration
                file, use the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'>IMAGE_INSTALL</ulink></filename>
                variable with the <filename>_append</filename> operator:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " strace"
                </literallayout>
                Use of the syntax is important - specifically, the space between
                the quote and the package name, which is
                <filename>strace</filename> in this example.
                This space is required since the <filename>_append</filename>
                operator does not add the space.
            </para>

            <para>
                Furthermore, you must use <filename>_append</filename> instead
                of the <filename>+=</filename> operator if you want to avoid
                ordering issues.
                The reason for this is because doing so unconditionally appends
                to the variable and avoids ordering problems due to the
                variable being set in image recipes and
                <filename>.bbclass</filename> files with operators like
                <filename>?=</filename>.
                Using <filename>_append</filename> ensures the operation takes
                affect.
            </para>

            <para>
                As shown in its simplest use,
                <filename>IMAGE_INSTALL_append</filename> affects all images.
                It is possible to extend the syntax so that the variable
                applies to a specific image only.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append_pn-core-image-minimal = " strace"
                </literallayout>
                This example adds <filename>strace</filename> to the
                <filename>core-image-minimal</filename> image only.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can add packages using a similar approach through the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL'>CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL</ulink></filename>
                variable.
                If you use this variable, only
                <filename>core-image-*</filename> images are affected.

            <title>Customizing Images Using Custom <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> and
                <filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></title>

            <para>
                Another method for customizing your image is to enable or
                disable high-level image features by using the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></ulink>
                and <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></ulink>
                variables.
                Although the functions for both variables are nearly equivalent,
                best practices dictate using <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename>
                from within a recipe and using
                <filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> from within
                your <filename>local.conf</filename> file, which is found in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.
            </para>

            <para>
                To understand how these features work, the best reference is
                <filename>meta/classes/core-image.bbclass</filename>.
                This class lists out the available
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></ulink>
                of which most map to package groups while some, such as
                <filename>debug-tweaks</filename> and
                <filename>read-only-rootfs</filename>, resolve as general
                configuration settings.
            </para>

            <para>
                In summary, the file looks at the contents of the
                <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> variable and then maps
                or configures the feature accordingly.
                Based on this information, the build system automatically
                adds the appropriate packages or configurations to the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'><filename>IMAGE_INSTALL</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Effectively, you are enabling extra features by extending the
                class or creating a custom class for use with specialized image
                <filename>.bb</filename> files.
            </para>

            <para>
                Use the <filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> variable
                from within your local configuration file.
                Using a separate area from which to enable features with
                this variable helps you avoid overwriting the features in the
                image recipe that are enabled with
                <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename>.
                The value of <filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> is added
                to <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> within
                <filename>meta/conf/bitbake.conf</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                To illustrate how you can use these variables to modify your
                image, consider an example that selects the SSH server.
                The Yocto Project ships with two SSH servers you can use
                with your images: Dropbear and OpenSSH.
                Dropbear is a minimal SSH server appropriate for
                resource-constrained environments, while OpenSSH is a
                well-known standard SSH server implementation.
                By default, the <filename>core-image-sato</filename> image
                is configured to use Dropbear.
                The <filename>core-image-full-cmdline</filename> and
                <filename>core-image-lsb</filename> images both
                include OpenSSH.
                The <filename>core-image-minimal</filename> image does not
                contain an SSH server.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can customize your image and change these defaults.
                Edit the <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> variable
                in your recipe or use the
                <filename>EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> in your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file so that it configures the
                image you are working with to include
                <filename>ssh-server-dropbear</filename> or
                <filename>ssh-server-openssh</filename>.

            <para>
                You can also customize an image by creating a custom recipe
                that defines additional software as part of the image.
                The following example shows the form for the two lines you need:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL = "packagegroup-core-x11-base package1 package2"

     inherit core-image
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Defining the software using a custom recipe gives you total
                control over the contents of the image.
                It is important to use the correct names of packages in the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'>IMAGE_INSTALL</ulink></filename>
                variable.
                You must use the OpenEmbedded notation and not the Debian notation for the names
                (e.g. <filename>glibc-dev</filename> instead of <filename>libc6-dev</filename>).
            </para>

            <para>
                The other method for creating a custom image is to base it on an existing image.
                For example, if you want to create an image based on <filename>core-image-sato</filename>
                but add the additional package <filename>strace</filename> to the image,
                copy the <filename>meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato.bb</filename> to a
                new <filename>.bb</filename> and add the following line to the end of the copy:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL += "strace"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <title>Customizing Images Using Custom Package Groups</title>

            <para>
                For complex custom images, the best approach for customizing
                an image is to create a custom package group recipe that is
                used to build the image or images.
                A good example of a package group recipe is
                <filename>meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-base.bb</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you examine that recipe, you see that the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGES'>PACKAGES</ulink></filename>
                variable lists the package group packages to produce.
                The <filename>inherit packagegroup</filename> statement
                sets appropriate default values and automatically adds
                <filename>-dev</filename>, <filename>-dbg</filename>, and
                <filename>-ptest</filename> complementary packages for each
                package specified in the <filename>PACKAGES</filename>
                statement.
                <note>
                    The <filename>inherit packages</filename> should be
                    located near the top of the recipe, certainly before
                    the <filename>PACKAGES</filename> statement.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                For each package you specify in <filename>PACKAGES</filename>,
                you can use
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'>RDEPENDS</ulink></filename>
                and

            <para>
                Here is a short, fabricated example showing the same basic
                pieces:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DESCRIPTION = "My Custom Package Groups"

            </para>

            <para>
                In the previous example, two package group packages are created with their dependencies and their
                recommended package dependencies listed: <filename>packagegroup-custom-apps</filename>, and
                <filename>packagegroup-custom-tools</filename>.
                To build an image using these package group packages, you need to add

            <title>Customizing an Image Hostname</title>

            <para>
                By default, the configured hostname (i.e.
                <filename>/etc/hostname</filename>) in an image is the
                same as the machine name.
                For example, if
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-MACHINE'><filename>MACHINE</filename></ulink>
                equals "qemux86", the configured hostname written to
                <filename>/etc/hostname</filename> is "qemux86".
            </para>

            <para>
                You can customize this name by altering the value of the
                "hostname" variable in the
                <filename>base-files</filename> recipe using either
                an append file or a configuration file.
                Use the following in an append file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     hostname="myhostname"
                </literallayout>
                Use the following in a configuration file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     hostname_pn-base-files = "myhostname"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Changing the default value of the variable "hostname" can be
                useful in certain situations.
                For example, suppose you need to do extensive testing on an
                image and you would like to easily identify the image
                under test from existing images with typical default
                hostnames.
                In this situation, you could change the default hostname to
                "testme", which results in all the images using the name
                "testme".
                Once testing is complete and you do not need to rebuild the
                image for test any longer, you can easily reset the default
                hostname.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another point of interest is that if you unset the variable,
                the image will have no default hostname in the filesystem.
                Here is an example that unsets the variable in a
                configuration file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     hostname_pn-base-files = ""
                </literallayout>
                Having no default hostname in the filesystem is suitable for
                environments that use dynamic hostnames such as virtual
                machines.

                    As long as you can extract or point to the source files,
                    the tool will construct a recipe and automatically
                    configure all pre-build information into the recipe.
                    For example, suppose you have an application that builds
                    using Autotools.
                    Creating the base recipe using
                    <filename>recipetool</filename> results in a recipe
                    that has the pre-build dependencies, license requirements,

                    Before writing a recipe from scratch, it is often useful to
                    discover whether someone else has already written one that
                    meets (or comes close to meeting) your needs.
                    The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded communities maintain many
                    recipes that might be candidates for what you are doing.
                    You can find a good central index of these recipes in the

                Once you have your base recipe, you should put it in your

                Locating it correctly ensures that the OpenEmbedded build

                Creating a new recipe is usually an iterative process that
                requires using BitBake to process the recipe multiple times in
                order to progressively discover and add information to the
                recipe file.
            </para>

            <para>
                Assuming you have sourced the build environment setup script (i.e.

                and you are in the

                use BitBake to process your recipe.
                All you need to provide is the
                <filename><replaceable>basename</replaceable></filename> of the recipe as described
                in the previous section:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>

            <para>
                During the build, the OpenEmbedded build system creates a
                temporary work directory for each recipe
                (<filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>)
                where it keeps extracted source files, log files, intermediate
                compilation and packaging files, and so forth.
            </para>

            <para>
                The path to the per-recipe temporary work directory depends
                on the context in which it is being built.
                The quickest way to find this path is to have BitBake return it
                by running the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -e <replaceable>basename</replaceable> | grep ^WORKDIR=
                </literallayout>
                As an example, assume a Source Directory top-level folder named
                <filename>poky</filename>, a default Build Directory at
                <filename>poky/build</filename>, and a
                <filename>qemux86-poky-linux</filename> machine target system.
                Furthermore, suppose your recipe is named
                <filename>foo_1.3.0.bb</filename>.
                In this case, the work directory the build system uses to
                build the package would be as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/foo/1.3.0-r0
                </literallayout>
                Inside this directory you can find sub-directories such as
                <filename>image</filename>, <filename>packages-split</filename>,
                and <filename>temp</filename>.
                After the build, you can examine these to determine how well
                the build went.
                <note>
                    You can find log files for each task in the recipe's
                    <filename>temp</filename> directory (e.g.

            <title>Fetching Code</title>

            <para>
                The first thing your recipe must do is specify how to fetch
                the source files.
                Fetching is controlled mainly through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Your recipe must have a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable
                that points to where the source is located.
                For a graphical representation of source locations, see the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#sources-dev-environment'>Sources</ulink>"
                section in the Yocto Project Reference Manual.
            </para>

            <para>
                The
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-fetch'><filename>do_fetch</filename></ulink>
                task uses the prefix of each entry in the
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable value to determine which
                fetcher to use to get your source files.
                It is the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable that triggers
                the fetcher.
                The
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-patch'><filename>do_patch</filename></ulink>
                task uses the variable after source is fetched to apply
                patches.
                The OpenEmbedded build system uses
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-FILESOVERRIDES'><filename>FILESOVERRIDES</filename></ulink>
                for scanning directory locations for local files in
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable in your recipe must
                define each unique location for your source files.
                It is good practice to not hard-code pathnames in an URL used
                in <filename>SRC_URI</filename>.
                Rather than hard-code these paths, use
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>,
                which causes the fetch process to use the version specified in
                the recipe filename.
                Specifying the version in this manner means that upgrading the
                recipe to a future version is as simple as renaming the recipe
                to match the new version.
            </para>

            <para>
                Here is a simple example from the
                <filename>meta/recipes-devtools/cdrtools/cdrtools-native_3.01a20.bb</filename>
                recipe where the source comes from a single tarball.
                Notice the use of the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>
                variable:

     SRC_URI = "ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/cdrtools-${PV}.tar.bz2"

            </para>

            <para>
                Files mentioned in <filename>SRC_URI</filename> whose names end
                in a typical archive extension (e.g. <filename>.tar</filename>,
                <filename>.tar.gz</filename>, <filename>.tar.bz2</filename>,
                <filename>.zip</filename>, and so forth), are automatically
                extracted during the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-unpack'><filename>do_unpack</filename></ulink>
                task.
                For another example that specifies these types of files, see
                the
                "<link linkend='new-recipe-autotooled-package'>Autotooled Package</link>"
                section.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another way of specifying source is from an SCM.
                For Git repositories, you must specify
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRCREV'><filename>SRCREV</filename></ulink>
                and you should specify
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>
                to include the revision with
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRCPV'><filename>SRCPV</filename></ulink>.
                Here is an example from the recipe
                <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/blktrace/blktrace_git.bb</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRCREV = "d6918c8832793b4205ed3bfede78c2f915c23385"

     PR = "r6"
     PV = "1.0.5+git${SRCPV}"

     SRC_URI = "git://git.kernel.dk/blktrace.git \
                file://ldflags.patch"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                If your <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement includes
                URLs pointing to individual files fetched from a remote server
                other than a version control system, BitBake attempts to
                verify the files against checksums defined in your recipe to
                ensure they have not been tampered with or otherwise modified
                since the recipe was written.
                Two checksums are used:
                <filename>SRC_URI[md5sum]</filename> and
                <filename>SRC_URI[sha256sum]</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                If your <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable points to
                more than a single URL (excluding SCM URLs), you need to
                provide the <filename>md5</filename> and
                <filename>sha256</filename> checksums for each URL.
                For these cases, you provide a name for each URL as part of
                the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> and then reference that name
                in the subsequent checksum statements.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI = "${DEBIAN_MIRROR}/main/a/apmd/apmd_3.2.2.orig.tar.gz;name=tarball \

     SRC_URI[tarball.md5sum] = "b1e6309e8331e0f4e6efd311c2d97fa8"
     SRC_URI[tarball.sha256sum] = "7f7d9f60b7766b852881d40b8ff91d8e39fccb0d1d913102a5c75a2dbb52332d"

     SRC_URI[patch.md5sum] = "57e1b689264ea80f78353519eece0c92"
     SRC_URI[patch.sha256sum] = "7905ff96be93d725544d0040e425c42f9c05580db3c272f11cff75b9aa89d430"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Proper values for <filename>md5</filename> and
                <filename>sha256</filename> checksums might be available
                with other signatures on the download page for the upstream
                source (e.g. <filename>md5</filename>,
                <filename>sha1</filename>, <filename>sha256</filename>,
                <filename>GPG</filename>, and so forth).
                Because the OpenEmbedded build system only deals with
                <filename>sha256sum</filename> and <filename>md5sum</filename>,
                you should verify all the signatures you find by hand.
            </para>

            <para>
                If no <filename>SRC_URI</filename> checksums are specified
                when you attempt to build the recipe, or you provide an
                incorrect checksum, the build will produce an error for each
                missing or incorrect checksum.
                As part of the error message, the build system provides
                the checksum string corresponding to the fetched file.
                Once you have the correct checksums, you can copy and paste
                them into your recipe and then run the build again to continue.
                <note>
                    As mentioned, if the upstream source provides signatures
                    for verifying the downloaded source code, you should
                    verify those manually before setting the checksum values
                    in the recipe and continuing with the build.

                This final example is a bit more complicated and is from the
                <filename>meta/recipes-sato/rxvt-unicode/rxvt-unicode_9.20.bb</filename>
                recipe.
                The example's <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement identifies
                multiple files as the source files for the recipe: a tarball, a
                patch file, a desktop file, and an icon.
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>

            <para>
                When you specify local files using the
                <filename>file://</filename> URI protocol, the build system
                fetches files from the local machine.
                The path is relative to the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-FILESPATH'><filename>FILESPATH</filename></ulink>
                variable and searches specific directories in a certain order:
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BP'><filename>BP</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>,
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BPN'><filename>BPN</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>,
                and <filename>files</filename>.
                The directories are assumed to be subdirectories of the
                directory in which the recipe or append file resides.
                For another example that specifies these types of files, see the
                "<link linkend='new-recipe-single-c-file-package-hello-world'>Single .c File Package (Hello World!)</link>"
                section.
            </para>

            <para>
                The previous example also specifies a patch file.
                Patch files are files whose names usually end in
                <filename>.patch</filename> or <filename>.diff</filename> but
                can end with compressed suffixes such as
                <filename>diff.gz</filename> and
                <filename>patch.bz2</filename>, for example.
                The build system automatically applies patches as described
                in the

                If you are fetching your source files from an upstream source
                archived tarball and the tarball's internal structure matches

            <para>
                For trying this out I created a new recipe named
                <filename>htop_1.0.2.bb</filename> and put it in
                <filename>poky/meta/recipes-extended/htop</filename>.
                There are two license type statements in my very simple
                recipe:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE = ""

     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = ""

     SRC_URI[md5sum] = ""
     SRC_URI[sha256sum] = ""
                </literallayout>
                Evidently, you need to run a <filename>bitbake -c cleanall htop</filename>.
                Next, you delete or comment out the two <filename>SRC_URI</filename>
                lines at the end and then attempt to build the software with
                <filename>bitbake htop</filename>.
                Doing so causes BitBake to report some errors and and give
                you the actual strings you need for the last two
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> lines.
                Prior to this, you have to dig around in the home page of the
                source for <filename>htop</filename> and determine that the
                software is released under GPLv2.
                You can provide that in the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
                statement.
                Now you edit your recipe to have those two strings for
                the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statements:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE = "GPLv2"

     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = ""

     SRC_URI = "${SOURCEFORGE_MIRROR}/htop/htop-${PV}.tar.gz"
     SRC_URI[md5sum] = "0d01cca8df3349c74569cefebbd9919e"
     SRC_URI[sha256sum] = "ee60657b044ece0df096c053060df7abf3cce3a568ab34d260049e6a37ccd8a1"
                </literallayout>
                At this point, you can build the software again using the
                <filename>bitbake htop</filename> command.
                There is just a set of errors now associated with the
                empty <filename>LIC_FILES_CHKSUM</filename> variable now.

            <title>Dependencies</title>

            <para>
                Most software packages have a short list of other packages
                that they require, which are called dependencies.
                These dependencies fall into two main categories: build-time
                dependencies, which are required when the software is built;
                and runtime dependencies, which are required to be installed
                on the target in order for the software to run.
            </para>

            <para>
                Within a recipe, you specify build-time dependencies using the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEPENDS'><filename>DEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Although nuances exist, items specified in
                <filename>DEPENDS</filename> should be names of other recipes.
                It is important that you specify all build-time dependencies
                explicitly.
                If you do not, due to the parallel nature of BitBake's
                execution, you can end up with a race condition where the
                dependency is present for one task of a recipe (e.g.
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-configure'><filename>do_configure</filename></ulink>)
                and then gone when the next task runs (e.g.
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-compile'><filename>do_compile</filename></ulink>).
            </para>

            <para>
                Another consideration is that configure scripts might
                automatically check for optional dependencies and enable
                corresponding functionality if those dependencies are found.
                This behavior means that to ensure deterministic results and
                thus avoid more race conditions, you need to either explicitly
                specify these dependencies as well, or tell the configure
                script explicitly to disable the functionality.
                If you wish to make a recipe that is more generally useful
                (e.g. publish the recipe in a layer for others to use),
                instead of hard-disabling the functionality, you can use the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGECONFIG'><filename>PACKAGECONFIG</filename></ulink>
                variable to allow functionality and the corresponding
                dependencies to be enabled and disabled easily by other
                users of the recipe.
            </para>

            <para>
                Similar to build-time dependencies, you specify runtime
                dependencies through a variable -
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>,
                which is package-specific.
                All variables that are package-specific need to have the name
                of the package added to the end as an override.
                Since the main package for a recipe has the same name as the
                recipe, and the recipe's name can be found through the
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>
                variable, then you specify the dependencies for the main
                package by setting <filename>RDEPENDS_${PN}</filename>.
                If the package were named <filename>${PN}-tools</filename>,
                then you would set <filename>RDEPENDS_${PN}-tools</filename>,
                and so forth.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some runtime dependencies will be set automatically at
                packaging time.
                These dependencies include any shared library dependencies
                (i.e. if a package "example" contains "libexample" and
                another package "mypackage" contains a binary that links to
                "libexample" then the OpenEmbedded build system will
                automatically add a runtime dependency to "mypackage" on
                "example").
                See the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#automatically-added-runtime-dependencies'>Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies</ulink>"

            <para>
                Most software provides some means of setting build-time
                configuration options before compilation.
                Typically, setting these options is accomplished by running a
                configure script with some options, or by modifying a build
                configuration file.
                <note>
                    As of Yocto Project Release 1.7, some of the core recipes
                    that package binary configuration scripts now disable the
                    scripts due to the scripts previously requiring error-prone
                    path substitution.
                    The OpenEmbedded build system uses
                    <filename>pkg-config</filename> now, which is much more
                    robust.
                    You can find a list of the <filename>*-config</filename>
                    scripts that are disabled list in the

                A major part of build-time configuration is about checking for
                build-time dependencies and possibly enabling optional
                functionality as a result.
                You need to specify any build-time dependencies for the
                software you are building in your recipe's
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEPENDS'><filename>DEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                value, in terms of other recipes that satisfy those
                dependencies.
                You can often find build-time or runtime
                dependencies described in the software's documentation.

                Once configuration succeeds, it is always good practice to
                look at the <filename>log.do_configure</filename> file to
                ensure that the appropriate options have been enabled and no
                additional build-time dependencies need to be added to
                <filename>DEPENDS</filename>.
                For example, if the configure script reports that it found
                something not mentioned in <filename>DEPENDS</filename>, or
                that it did not find something that it needed for some
                desired optional functionality, then you would need to add
                those to <filename>DEPENDS</filename>.
                Looking at the log might also reveal items being checked for,
                enabled, or both that you do not want, or items not being found
                that are in <filename>DEPENDS</filename>, in which case

            <title>Using Headers to Interface with Devices</title>

            <para>
                If your recipe builds an application that needs to
                communicate with some device or needs an API into a custom
                kernel, you will need to provide appropriate header files.
                Under no circumstances should you ever modify the existing
                <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/linux-libc-headers/linux-libc-headers.inc</filename>
                file.
                These headers are used to build <filename>libc</filename> and
                must not be compromised with custom or machine-specific
                header information.
                If you customize <filename>libc</filename> through modified
                headers all other applications that use
                <filename>libc</filename> thus become affected.
                <note><title>Warning</title>
                    Never copy and customize the <filename>libc</filename>
                    header file (i.e.
                    <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/linux-libc-headers/linux-libc-headers.inc</filename>).
                </note>
                The correct way to interface to a device or custom kernel is
                to use a separate package that provides the additional headers
                for the driver or other unique interfaces.
                When doing so, your application also becomes responsible for
                creating a dependency on that specific provider.

                        Consider that file to be part of the
                        <filename>libc</filename> system, and not something
                        you use to access the kernel directly.
                        You should access <filename>libc</filename> through
                        specific <filename>libc</filename> calls.

                        Applications that must talk directly to devices
                        should either provide necessary headers themselves,
                        or establish a dependency on a special headers package
                        that is specific to that driver.

            <para>
                For example, suppose you want to modify an existing header
                that adds I/O control or network support.
                If the modifications are used by a small number programs,
                providing a unique version of a header is easy and has little
                impact.
                When doing so, bear in mind the guidelines in the previous
                list.
                <note>
                    If for some reason your changes need to modify the behavior
                    of the <filename>libc</filename>, and subsequently all
                    other applications on the system, use a
                    <filename>.bbappend</filename> to modify the
                    <filename>linux-kernel-headers.inc</filename> file.
                    However, take care to not make the changes
                    machine specific.

                Consider a case where your kernel is older and you need
                an older <filename>libc</filename> ABI.
                The headers installed by your recipe should still be a
                standard mainline kernel, not your own custom one.
            </para>

            <para>
                When you use custom kernel headers you need to get them from

                which is the directory with kernel headers that are
                required to build out-of-tree modules.
                Your recipe will also need the following:

                How your software is built affects what you must do to be
                sure your software is installed correctly.
                The following list describes what you must do for installation
                depending on the type of build system used by the software
                being built:

                        If the software your recipe is building uses Autotools
                        or CMake, the OpenEmbedded build
                        system understands how to install the software.
                        Consequently, you do not have to have a

                        However, if you wish to install additional files not
                        already being installed by

                        How you pass that path is dependent on how the

                        layout.
                        For example, you might need to replace hard-coded paths
                        in an initscript with values of variables provided by
                        the build system, such as replacing
                        <filename>/usr/bin/</filename> with
                        <filename>${bindir}</filename>.
                        If you do perform such modifications during
                        <filename>do_install</filename>, be sure to modify the
                        destination file after copying rather than before
                        copying.
                        Modifying after copying ensures that the build system
                        can re-execute <filename>do_install</filename> if
                        needed.

                <filename>do_install_append</filename> function.
                If your recipe already has a <filename>do_install</filename>
                function, update the function near its end rather than

                        Depending on what your recipe is building and how it
                        is configured, it might be important to mark the
                        packages produced as being specific to a particular
                        machine, or to mark them as not being specific to
                        a particular machine or architecture at all.</para>
                        <para>By default, packages apply to any machine with the
                        same architecture as the target machine.
                        When a recipe produces packages that are
                        machine-specific (e.g. the

                        value is passed into the configure script or a patch
                        is applied only for a particular machine), you should
                        mark them as such by adding the following to the
                        recipe:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"
                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>On the other hand, if the recipe produces packages
                        that do not contain anything specific to the target
                        machine or architecture at all (e.g. recipes
                        that simply package script files or configuration
                        files), you should use the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-allarch'><filename>allarch</filename></ulink>
                        class to do this for you by adding this to your
                        recipe:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     inherit allarch
                        </literallayout>
                        Ensuring that the package architecture is correct is
                        not critical while you are doing the first few builds
                        of your recipe.
                        However, it is important in order
                        to ensure that your recipe rebuilds (or does not
                        rebuild) appropriately in response to changes in
                        configuration, and to ensure that you get the
                        appropriate packages installed on the target machine,
                        particularly if you run separate builds for more
                        than one target machine.

            <title>Sharing Files Between Recipes</title>

            <para>
                Recipes often need to use files provided by other recipes on
                the build host.
                For example, an application linking to a common library needs
                access to the library itself and its associated headers.
                The way this access is accomplished is by populating a sysroot
                with files.
                Each recipe has two sysroots in its work directory, one for
                target files
                (<filename>recipe-sysroot</filename>) and one for files that
                are native to the build host
                (<filename>recipe-sysroot-native</filename>).
                <note>
                    You could find the term "staging" used within the Yocto
                    project regarding files populating sysroots (e.g. the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-STAGING_DIR'><filename>STAGING_DIR</filename></ulink>
                    variable).
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Recipes should never populate the sysroot directly (i.e. write
                files into sysroot).
                Instead, files should be installed into standard locations
                during the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                task within the
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-D'><filename>D</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>
                directory.
                The reason for this limitation is that almost all files that
                populate the sysroot are cataloged in manifests in order to
                ensure the files can be removed later when a recipe is either
                modified or removed.
                Thus, the sysroot is able to remain free from stale files.
            </para>

            <para>
                A subset of the files installed by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                task are used by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-populate_sysroot'><filename>do_populate_sysroot</filename></ulink>

                variable to automatically populate the sysroot.
                It is possible to modify the list of directories that populate
                the sysroot.
                The following example shows how you could add the
                <filename>/opt</filename> directory to the list of
                directories within a recipe:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SYSROOT_DIRS += "/opt"

            <title>Properly Versioning Pre-Release Recipes</title>

            <para>
                Sometimes the name of a recipe can lead to versioning
                problems when the recipe is upgraded to a final release.
                For example, consider the
                <filename>irssi_0.8.16-rc1.bb</filename> recipe file in
                the list of example recipes in the
                "<link linkend='new-recipe-storing-and-naming-the-recipe'>Storing and Naming the Recipe</link>"
                section.
                This recipe is at a release candidate stage (i.e.
                "rc1").
                When the recipe is released, the recipe filename becomes
                <filename>irssi_0.8.16.bb</filename>.
                The version change from <filename>0.8.16-rc1</filename>
                to <filename>0.8.16</filename> is seen as a decrease by the
                build system and package managers, so the resulting packages
                will not correctly trigger an upgrade.
            </para>

            <para>
                In order to ensure the versions compare properly, the
                recommended convention is to set
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>
                within the recipe to
                "<replaceable>previous_version</replaceable>+<replaceable>current_version</replaceable>".
                You can use an additional variable so that you can use the
                current version elsewhere.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     REALPV = "0.8.16-rc1"
     PV = "0.8.15+${REALPV}"
                </literallayout>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='new-recipe-post-installation-scripts'>
            <title>Post-Installation Scripts</title>

            <para>
                Post-installation scripts run immediately after installing
                a package on the target or during image creation when a
                package is included in an image.
                To add a post-installation script to a package, add a
                <filename>pkg_postinst_</filename><replaceable>PACKAGENAME</replaceable><filename>()</filename> function to
                the recipe file (<filename>.bb</filename>) and replace
                <replaceable>PACKAGENAME</replaceable> with the name of the package
                you want to attach to the <filename>postinst</filename>
                script.
                To apply the post-installation script to the main package
                for the recipe, which is usually what is required, specify
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>
                in place of <replaceable>PACKAGENAME</replaceable>.
            </para>

            <para>
                A post-installation function has the following structure:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     pkg_postinst_<replaceable>PACKAGENAME</replaceable>() {
     # Commands to carry out
     }
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The script defined in the post-installation function is
                called when the root filesystem is created.
                If the script succeeds, the package is marked as installed.
                If the script fails, the package is marked as unpacked and
                the script is executed when the image boots again.
                <note>
                    Any RPM post-installation script that runs on the target
                    should return a 0 exit code.
                    RPM does not allow non-zero exit codes for these scripts,
                    and the RPM package manager will cause the package to fail
                    installation on the target.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Sometimes it is necessary for the execution of a
                post-installation script to be delayed until the first boot.
                For example, the script might need to be executed on the
                device itself.
                To delay script execution until boot time, use the following
                structure in the post-installation script:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     pkg_postinst_<replaceable>PACKAGENAME</replaceable>() {
     if [ x"$D" = "x" ]; then
          # Actions to carry out on the device go here
     else
          exit 1
     fi
     }
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The previous example delays execution until the image boots
                again because the environment variable <filename>D</filename>
                points to the directory containing the image when
                the root filesystem is created at build time but is unset
                when executed on the first boot.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you have recipes that use <filename>pkg_postinst</filename>
                scripts and they require the use of non-standard native
                tools that have dependencies during rootfs construction, you
                need to use the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_WRITE_DEPS'><filename>PACKAGE_WRITE_DEPS</filename></ulink>
                variable in your recipe to list these tools.
                If you do not use this variable, the tools might be missing and
                execution of the post-installation script is deferred until
                first boot.
                Deferring the script to first boot is undesirable and for
                read-only rootfs impossible.
            </para>

            <note>
                Equivalent support for pre-install, pre-uninstall, and
                post-uninstall scripts exist by way of
                <filename>pkg_preinst</filename>,
                <filename>pkg_prerm</filename>, and
                <filename>pkg_postrm</filename>, respectively.
                These scrips work in exactly the same way as does
                <filename>pkg_postinst</filename> with the exception that they
                run at different times.
                Also, because of when they run, they are not applicable to
                being run at image creation time like
                <filename>pkg_postinst</filename>.

                    Building an application from a single file that is stored
                    locally (e.g. under <filename>files</filename>) requires
                    a recipe that has the file listed in the
                    <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'>SRC_URI</ulink></filename>
                    variable.
                    Additionally, you need to manually write the

                    You can modify the recipe to split the binaries into separate packages:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     require xorg-lib-common.inc

     SUMMARY = "Xpm: X Pixmap extension library"
     LICENSE = "BSD"
     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=51f4270b012ecd4ab1a164f5f4ed6cf7"
     DEPENDS += "libxext libsm libxt"
     PE = "1"

     XORG_PN = "libXpm"

     PACKAGES =+ "sxpm cxpm"
     FILES_cxpm = "${bindir}/cxpm"
     FILES_sxpm = "${bindir}/sxpm"
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    In the previous example, we want to ship the <filename>sxpm</filename>
                    and <filename>cxpm</filename> binaries in separate packages.
                    Since <filename>bindir</filename> would be packaged into the main
                    <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'>PN</ulink></filename>
                    package by default, we prepend the <filename>PACKAGES</filename>
                    variable so additional package names are added to the start of list.
                    This results in the extra <filename>FILES_*</filename>
                    variables then containing information that define which files and
                    directories go into which packages.
                    Files included by earlier packages are skipped by latter packages.
                    Thus, the main <filename>PN</filename> package
                    does not include the above listed files.

                    Sometimes, you need to add pre-compiled binaries to an
                    image.
                    For example, suppose that binaries for proprietary code
                    exist, which are created by a particular division of a
                    company.
                    Your part of the company needs to use those binaries as
                    part of an image that you are building using the
                    OpenEmbedded build system.
                    Since you only have the binaries and not the source code,
                    you cannot use a typical recipe that expects to fetch the
                    source specified in
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                    and then compile it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    One method is to package the binaries and then install them
                    as part of the image.
                    Generally, it is not a good idea to package binaries
                    since, among other things, it can hinder the ability to
                    reproduce builds and could lead to compatibility problems
                    with ABI in the future.
                    However, sometimes you have no choice.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The easiest solution is to create a recipe that uses
                    the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-bin-package'><filename>bin_package</filename></ulink>
                    class and to be sure that you are using default locations
                    for build artifacts.
                    In most cases, the <filename>bin_package</filename> class
                    handles "skipping" the configure and compile steps as well
                    as sets things up to grab packages from the appropriate
                    area.
                    In particular, this class sets <filename>noexec</filename>
                    on both the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-configure'><filename>do_configure</filename></ulink>
                    and
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-compile'><filename>do_compile</filename></ulink>
                    tasks, sets
                    <filename>FILES_${PN}</filename> to "/" so that it picks
                    up all files, and sets up a
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                    task, which effectively copies all files from
                    <filename>${S}</filename> to <filename>${D}</filename>.
                    The <filename>bin_package</filename> class works well when
                    the files extracted into <filename>${S}</filename> are
                    already laid out in the way they should be laid out
                    on the target.

                However, aiming for at least a consistent style is a good idea.
                Some practices, such as omitting spaces around

                Although well within the capabilities of the Yocto Project,

            <para>
                To add a new machine, you need to add a new machine
                configuration file to the layer's
                <filename>conf/machine</filename> directory.
                This configuration file provides details about the device

            <para>
                The OpenEmbedded build system uses the root name of the
                machine configuration file to reference the new machine.
                For example, given a machine configuration file named
                <filename>crownbay.conf</filename>, the build system
                recognizes the machine as "crownbay".

            <title>Adding a Kernel for the Machine</title>

            <para>
                The OpenEmbedded build system needs to be able to build a kernel
                for the machine.
                You need to either create a new kernel recipe for this machine,
                or extend an existing kernel recipe.
                You can find several kernel recipe examples in the
                Source Directory at
                <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/linux</filename>
                that you can use as references.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you are creating a new kernel recipe, normal recipe-writing
                rules apply for setting up a
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'>SRC_URI</ulink></filename>.
                Thus, you need to specify any necessary patches and set
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'>S</ulink></filename>
                to point at the source code.
                You need to create a <filename>do_configure</filename> task that
                configures the unpacked kernel with a
                <filename>defconfig</filename> file.
                You can do this by using a <filename>make defconfig</filename>
                command or, more commonly, by copying in a suitable
                <filename>defconfig</filename> file and then running
                <filename>make oldconfig</filename>.
                By making use of <filename>inherit kernel</filename> and
                potentially some of the <filename>linux-*.inc</filename> files,
                most other functionality is centralized and the defaults of the
                class normally work well.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you are extending an existing kernel recipe, it is usually
                a matter of adding a suitable <filename>defconfig</filename>
                file.
                The file needs to be added into a location similar to
                <filename>defconfig</filename> files used for other machines
                in a given kernel recipe.
                A possible way to do this is by listing the file in the
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> and adding the machine to the
                expression in
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-COMPATIBLE_MACHINE'>COMPATIBLE_MACHINE</ulink></filename>:

            <title>Adding a Formfactor Configuration File</title>

            <para>
                A formfactor configuration file provides information about the
                target hardware for which the image is being built and information that
                the build system cannot obtain from other sources such as the kernel.
                Some examples of information contained in a formfactor configuration file include
                framebuffer orientation, whether or not the system has a keyboard,
                the positioning of the keyboard in relation to the screen, and
                the screen resolution.
            </para>

            <para>
                The build system uses reasonable defaults in most cases.
                However, if customization is
                necessary, you need to create a <filename>machconfig</filename> file
                in the <filename>meta/recipes-bsp/formfactor/files</filename>
                directory.
                This directory contains directories for specific machines such as
                <filename>qemuarm</filename> and <filename>qemux86</filename>.
                For information about the settings available and the defaults, see the

        <title>Finding Temporary Source Code</title>

        <para>
            You might find it helpful during development to modify the
            temporary source code used by recipes to build packages.
            For example, suppose you are developing a patch and you need to
            experiment a bit to figure out your solution.
            After you have initially built the package, you can iteratively
            tweak the source code, which is located in the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>,
            and then you can force a re-compile and quickly test your altered
            code.
            Once you settle on a solution, you can then preserve your changes
            in the form of patches.
        </para>

        <para>
            During a build, the unpacked temporary source code used by recipes
            to build packages is available in the Build Directory as
            defined by the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'><filename>S</filename></ulink>
            variable.
            Below is the default value for the <filename>S</filename> variable
            as defined in the
            <filename>meta/conf/bitbake.conf</filename> configuration file
            in the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     S = "${WORKDIR}/${BP}"
            </literallayout>
            You should be aware that many recipes override the
            <filename>S</filename> variable.
            For example, recipes that fetch their source from Git usually set
            <filename>S</filename> to <filename>${WORKDIR}/git</filename>.

                    Next, add the patch into the

                    of the recipe.
                    Here is an example:

            When debugging certain commands or even when just editing packages,
            <filename>devshell</filename> can be a useful tool.
            When you invoke <filename>devshell</filename>, all tasks up to and
            including
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-patch'><filename>do_patch</filename></ulink>
            are run for the specified target.
            Then, a new terminal is opened and you are placed in
            <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'><filename>S</filename></ulink><filename>}</filename>,
            the source directory.
            In the new terminal, all the OpenEmbedded build-related environment variables are
            still defined so you can use commands such as <filename>configure</filename> and
            <filename>make</filename>.
            The commands execute just as if the OpenEmbedded build system were executing them.
            Consequently, working this way can be helpful when debugging a build or preparing
            software to be used with the OpenEmbedded build system.

        <para>
            Within this environment, you can run configure or compile
            commands as if they were being run by
            the OpenEmbedded build system itself.
            As noted earlier, the working directory also automatically changes to the
            Source Directory (<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'><filename>S</filename></ulink>).
        </para>

        <para>
            To manually run a specific task using <filename>devshell</filename>,
            run the corresponding <filename>run.*</filename> script in

            If a task's script does not exist, which would be the case if the task was

                        just as it would be run using the

        <title>Using a Development Python Shell</title>

        <para>
            Similar to working within a development shell as described in
            the previous section, you can also spawn and work within an
            interactive Python development shell.
            When debugging certain commands or even when just editing packages,
            <filename>devpyshell</filename> can be a useful tool.
            When you invoke <filename>devpyshell</filename>, all tasks up to and
            including
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-patch'><filename>do_patch</filename></ulink>
            are run for the specified target.
            Then a new terminal is opened.
            Additionally, key Python objects and code are available in the same
            way they are to BitBake tasks, in particular, the data store 'd'.
            So, commands such as the following are useful when exploring the data
            store and running functions:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     pydevshell> d.getVar("STAGING_DIR", True)
     '/media/build1/poky/build/tmp/sysroots'
     pydevshell> d.getVar("STAGING_DIR", False)
     '${TMPDIR}/sysroots'
     pydevshell> d.setVar("FOO", "bar")
     pydevshell> d.getVar("FOO", True)
     'bar'
     pydevshell> d.delVar("FOO")
     pydevshell> d.getVar("FOO", True)
     pydevshell> bb.build.exec_func("do_unpack", d)
     pydevshell>
            </literallayout>
            The commands execute just as if the OpenEmbedded build system were executing them.
            Consequently, working this way can be helpful when debugging a build or preparing
            software to be used with the OpenEmbedded build system.

        <para>
            Bitbake also has functionality that allows you to build
            multiple targets at the same time, where each target uses
            a different configuration.
        </para>

        <para>
            In order to accomplish this, you setup each of the configurations
            you need to use in parallel by placing the configuration files in
            your current build directory alongside the usual
            <filename>local.conf</filename> file.
        </para>

        <para>
            Follow these guidelines to create an environment that supports
            multiple configurations:

                    <emphasis>Create Configuration Files</emphasis>:
                    You need to create a single configuration file for each
                    configuration for which you want to add support.
                    These files would contain lines such as the following:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     MACHINE = "A"
                    </literallayout>
                    The files would contain any other variables that can
                    be set and built in the same directory.
                    <note>
                        You can change the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TMPDIR'><filename>TMPDIR</filename></ulink>

                    <para>
                    Furthermore, the configuration file must be located in the

                    <filename>local.conf</filename> resides.
                    The reason for this restriction is because the
                    <filename>BBPATH</filename> variable is not constructed
                    until the layers are parsed.
                    Consequently, using the configuration file as a
                    pre-configuration file is not possible unless it is
                    located in the current working directory.

            <para>
                The build system offers the ability to build libraries with different
                target optimizations or architecture formats and combine these together
                into one system image.
                You can link different binaries in the image
                against the different libraries as needed for specific use cases.
                This feature is called "Multilib."
            </para>

            <para>
                An example would be where you have most of a system compiled in 32-bit
                mode using 32-bit libraries, but you have something large, like a database
                engine, that needs to be a 64-bit application and uses 64-bit libraries.
                Multilib allows you to get the best of both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.
            </para>

            <para>
                While the Multilib feature is most commonly used for 32 and 64-bit differences,
                the approach the build system uses facilitates different target optimizations.
                You could compile some binaries to use one set of libraries and other binaries
                to use a different set of libraries.
                The libraries could differ in architecture, compiler options, or other
                optimizations.

                    User-specific requirements drive the Multilib feature.
                    Consequently, there is no one "out-of-the-box" configuration that likely
                    exists to meet your needs.

                <para>
                    In order to enable Multilib, you first need to ensure your recipe is
                    extended to support multiple libraries.
                    Many standard recipes are already extended and support multiple libraries.
                    You can check in the <filename>meta/conf/multilib.conf</filename>
                    configuration file in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink> to see how this is
                    done using the

                    variable.
                    Eventually, all recipes will be covered and this list will
                    not be needed.

                <para>
                    For the most part, the Multilib class extension works automatically to
                    extend the package name from <filename>${PN}</filename> to
                    <filename>${MLPREFIX}${PN}</filename>, where <filename>MLPREFIX</filename>
                    is the particular multilib (e.g. "lib32-" or "lib64-").
                    Standard variables such as

                    are automatically extended by the system.
                    If you are extending any manual code in the recipe, you can use the
                    <filename>${MLPREFIX}</filename> variable to ensure those names are extended
                    correctly.
                    This automatic extension code resides in <filename>multilib.bbclass</filename>.

                <para>
                    After you have set up the recipes, you need to define the actual
                    combination of multiple libraries you want to build.
                    You accomplish this through your <filename>local.conf</filename>
                    configuration file in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.
                    An example configuration would be as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     MACHINE = "qemux86-64"
     require conf/multilib.conf
     MULTILIBS = "multilib:lib32"
     DEFAULTTUNE_virtclass-multilib-lib32 = "x86"
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " lib32-glib-2.0"
                    </literallayout>
                    This example enables an
                    additional library named <filename>lib32</filename> alongside the
                    normal target packages.
                    When combining these "lib32" alternatives, the example uses "x86" for tuning.
                    For information on this particular tuning, see

                </para>

                <para>
                    The example then includes <filename>lib32-glib-2.0</filename>
                    in all the images, which illustrates one method of including a
                    multiple library dependency.
                    You can use a normal image build to include this dependency,
                    for example:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake core-image-sato
                    </literallayout>
                    You can also build Multilib packages specifically with a command like this:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake lib32-glib-2.0

            <title>Installing Multiple Versions of the Same Library</title>

            <para>
                Situations can exist where you need to install and use
                multiple versions of the same library on the same system
                at the same time.
                These situations almost always exist when a library API
                changes and you have multiple pieces of software that
                depend on the separate versions of the library.
                To accommodate these situations, you can install multiple
                versions of the same library in parallel on the same system.
            </para>

            <para>
                The process is straightforward as long as the libraries use
                proper versioning.
                With properly versioned libraries, all you need to do to
                individually specify the libraries is create separate,
                appropriately named recipes where the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink> part of the
                name includes a portion that differentiates each library version
                (e.g.the major part of the version number).
                Thus, instead of having a single recipe that loads one version
                of a library (e.g. <filename>clutter</filename>), you provide
                multiple recipes that result in different versions
                of the libraries you want.
                As an example, the following two recipes would allow the
                two separate versions of the <filename>clutter</filename>
                library to co-exist on the same system:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     clutter-1.6_1.6.20.bb
     clutter-1.8_1.8.4.bb
                </literallayout>
                Additionally, if you have other recipes that depend on a given
                library, you need to use the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEPENDS'><filename>DEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                variable to create the dependency.
                Continuing with the same example, if you want to have a recipe
                depend on the 1.8 version of the <filename>clutter</filename>
                library, use the following in your recipe:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEPENDS = "clutter-1.8"
                </literallayout>

            GObject introspection is the only way to do it.
        </para>

        <para>
            This section describes the Yocto Project support for generating
            and packaging GObject introspection data.
            GObject introspection data is a description of the
            API provided by libraries built on top of GLib framework,
            and, in particular, that framework's GObject mechanism.
            GObject Introspection Repository (GIR) files go to
            <filename>-dev</filename> packages,
            <filename>typelib</filename> files go to main packages as they
            are packaged together with libraries that are introspected.
        </para>

        <para>
            The data is generated when building such a library, by linking
            the library with a small executable binary that asks the library
            to describe itself, and then executing the binary and
            processing its output.
        </para>

        <para>
            Generating this data in a cross-compilation environment
            is difficult because the library is produced for the target
            architecture, but its code needs to be executed on the build host.
            This problem is solved with the OpenEmbedded build system by
            running the code through QEMU, which allows precisely that.
            Unfortunately, QEMU does not always work perfectly as mentioned
            in the xxx section.

            <para>
                You might find that you do not want to generate
                introspection data.
                Or, perhaps QEMU does not work on your build host and
                target architecture combination.
                If so, you can use either of the following methods to
                disable GIR file generations:

     DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "gobject-introspection-data"

                        Adding this statement disables generating
                        introspection data using QEMU but will still enable
                        building introspection tools and libraries
                        (i.e. building them does not require the use of QEMU).

     MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "qemu-usermode"
                        </literallayout>
                        Adding this statement disables the use of QEMU
                        when building packages for your machine.
                        Currently, this feature is used only by introspection
                        recipes and has the same effect as the previously
                        described option.
                        <note>
                            Future releases of the Yocto Project might have

                If you disable introspection data, you can still
                obtain it through other means such as copying the data
                from a suitable sysroot, or by generating it on the
                target hardware.
                The OpenEmbedded build system does not currently
                provide specific support for these techniques.

        <title>Creating Partitioned Images Using Wic</title>

        <para>
            Creating an image for a particular hardware target using the
            OpenEmbedded build system does not necessarily mean you can boot
            that image as is on your device.
            Physical devices accept and boot images in various ways depending
            on the specifics of the device.
            Usually, information about the hardware can tell you what image
            format the device requires.
            Should your device require multiple partitions on an SD card, flash,
            or an HDD, you can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator,
	        Wic, to create the properly partitioned image.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <filename>wic</filename> command generates partitioned
            images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
            Image generation is driven by partitioning commands
            contained in an Openembedded kickstart file
            (<filename>.wks</filename>) specified either directly on
            the command line or as one of a selection of canned
            kickstart files as shown with the
            <filename>wic list images</filename> command in the
            "<link linkend='using-a-provided-kickstart-file'>Using an Existing Kickstart File</link>"
            section.
            When you apply the command to a given set of build
            artifacts, the result is an image or set of images that
            can be directly written onto media and used on a particular
            system.

                        The "oe" diphthong in "oeic" was promoted to the
                        letter "w", because "oeic" is both difficult to
                        remember and to pronounce.

                    command line.
                    The primary use for raw mode is if you have built

                    root filesystem locations, and so forth.
                    Contrast this behavior with cooked mode where Wic
                    looks in the Build Directory (e.g.

                can use an existing file provided by the Wic installation.
                As shipped, kickstart files can be found in the
                Yocto Project
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-repositories'>Source Repositories</ulink>

                Use the following command to list the available kickstart
                files:

                    This example runs in Cooked Mode and uses the
                    <filename>mkefidisk</filename> kickstart file:

                    The previous example shows the easiest way to create
                    an image by running in cooked mode and supplying
                    a kickstart file and the "-e" option to point to the
                    existing build artifacts.
                    Your <filename>local.conf</filename> file needs to have
                    the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-MACHINE'><filename>MACHINE</filename></ulink>

                    Once the image builds, the output provides image

                    <note>
                        You should always verify the details provided in the
                        output to make sure that the image was indeed

                    built your image, and boot from the media.
                    You can write the image by using

                <title>Using a Modified Kickstart File</title>

                <para>
                    Because partitioned image creation is driven by the
                    kickstart file, it is easy to affect image creation by
                    changing the parameters in the file.
                    This next example demonstrates that through modification
                    of the <filename>directdisk-gpt</filename> kickstart
                    file.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As mentioned earlier, you can use the command
                    <filename>wic list images</filename> to show the list
                    of existing kickstart files.
                    The directory in which the
                    <filename>directdisk-gpt.wks</filename> file resides is
                    <filename>scripts/lib/image/canned-wks/</filename>,
                    which is located in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
                    (e.g. <filename>poky</filename>).
                    Because available files reside in this directory,
                    you can create and add your own custom files to the
                    directory.
                    Subsequent use of the
                    <filename>wic list images</filename> command would then
                    include your kickstart files.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In this example, the existing
                    <filename>directdisk-gpt</filename> file already does
                    most of what is needed.
                    However, for the hardware in this example, the image
                    will need to boot from <filename>sdb</filename> instead
                    of <filename>sda</filename>, which is what the
                    <filename>directdisk-gpt</filename> kickstart file
                    uses.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The example begins by making a copy of the
                    <filename>directdisk-gpt.wks</filename> file in the
                    <filename>scripts/lib/image/canned-wks</filename>
                    directory and then by changing the lines that specify
                    the target disk from which to boot.
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cp /home/scottrif/poky/scripts/lib/wic/canned-wks/directdisk-gpt.wks \
          /home/scottrif/poky/scripts/lib/wic/canned-wks/directdisksdb-gpt.wks
                    </literallayout>
                    Next, the example modifies the
                    <filename>directdisksdb-gpt.wks</filename> file and
                    changes all instances of
                    "<filename>--ondisk sda</filename>" to
                    "<filename>--ondisk sdb</filename>".
                    The example changes the following two lines and leaves
                    the remaining lines untouched:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     part /boot --source bootimg-pcbios --ondisk sdb --label boot --active --align 1024
     part / --source rootfs --ondisk sdb --fstype=ext4 --label platform --align 1024 --use-uuid
                    </literallayout>
                    Once the lines are changed, the example generates the
                    <filename>directdisksdb-gpt</filename> image.
                    The command points the process at the
                    <filename>core-image-minimal</filename> artifacts for
                    the Next Unit of Computing (nuc)

                <para>
                    Wic image manipulation allows you to shorten turnaround
                    time during image development.
                    For example, you can use Wic to delete the kernel partition
                    of a Wic image and then insert a newly built kernel.
                    This saves you time from having to rebuild the entire image
                    each time you modify the kernel.
                    <note>
                        In order to use Wic to manipulate a Wic image as in
                        this example, your development machine must have the

        <title>Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image</title>

        <para>
            An initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) image provides a temporary
            root filesystem used for early system initialization (e.g.
            loading of modules needed to locate and mount the "real" root
            filesystem).
            <note>
                The initramfs image is the successor of initial RAM disk
                (initrd).
                It is a "copy in and out" (cpio) archive of the initial
                filesystem that gets loaded into memory during the Linux
                startup process.
                Because Linux uses the contents of the archive during
                initialization, the initramfs image needs to contain all of the
                device drivers and tools needed to mount the final root
                filesystem.

                    <note><title>Tip</title>
                        It is recommended that you do bundle the initramfs
                        image with the kernel image to avoid circular
                        dependencies between the kernel recipe and the
                        initramfs recipe should the initramfs image
                        include kernel modules.

                    Setting the <filename>INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE</filename>
                    flag causes the initramfs image to be unpacked
                    into the <filename>${B}/usr/</filename> directory.
                    The unpacked initramfs image is then passed to the kernel's
                    <filename>Makefile</filename> using the

                    variable, allowing the initramfs image to be built into
                    the kernel normally.
                    <note>
                        If you choose to not bundle the initramfs image with

<!--
Some notes from Cal:

    A non-bundled initramfs is essentially an initrd, which I am discovering
    to be rather confusingly supported in OE at the moment.

    Its primarily handled through INITRD_IMAGE(_LIVE/_VM) and INITRD(_LIVE/_VM)
    variables. INITRD_IMAGE* is the primary image target, which gets added to
    INITRD*, which is a list of cpio filesystems. You can add more cpio
    filesystems to the INITRD variable to add more to the initrd. For
    instance, meta-intel adds intel-microcode via the following:

        INITRD_LIVE_prepend = "${@bb.utils.contains('MACHINE_FEATURES', 'intel-ucode', '${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/microcode.cpio ', '', d)}"

    If 'intel-ucode' is in MACHINE_FEATURES, this resolves to:

        INITRD_LIVE_prepend = "${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/microcode.cpio "

    Unfortunately you need the full path, and its up to you to sort out
    dependencies as well. For instance, we have the following:

        MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS_append = "${@bb.utils.contains('MACHINE_FEATURES', 'intel-ucode', ' intel-microcode', '', d)}"

    which resolves to:

        MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS_append = "intel-microcode"

    However, the above is only true with the "live" IMAGE_FSTYPE. Wic is
    another beast entirely, with current wic kickstart files not supporting
    initrds, and only partial support in the source plugins. That being said,
    I know the generic bootfs work Ed is working on will help immensely in this
    aspect. He or Saul can provide more details here.

    Anyhow, its rather fractured and confusing and could probably use a
    rework honestly. I don't know how feasible it is to document all the
    details and corner cases of this area.

            When securing your image is of concern, there are steps, tools,
            and variables that you can consider to help you reach the
            security goals you need for your particular device.
            Not all situations are identical when it comes to making an
            image secure.
            Consequently, this section provides some guidance and suggestions
            for consideration when you want to make your image more secure.
            <note>
                Because the security requirements and risks are
                different for every type of device, this section cannot
                provide a complete reference on securing your custom OS.
                It is strongly recommended that you also consult other sources
                of information on embedded Linux system hardening and on
                security.

            <para>
                General considerations exist that help you create more
                secure images.
                You should consider the following suggestions to help
                make your device more secure:

                        Scan additional code you are adding to the system
                        (e.g. application code) by using static analysis
                        tools.
                        Look for buffer overflows and other potential
                        security problems.

                        Pay particular attention to the security for
                        any web-based administration interface.
                        </para>
                        <para>Web interfaces typically need to perform
                        administrative functions and tend to need to run with
                        elevated privileges.
                        Thus, the consequences resulting from the interface's
                        security becoming compromised can be serious.
                        Look for common web vulnerabilities such as
                        cross-site-scripting (XSS), unvalidated inputs,
                        and so forth.</para>
                        <para>As with system passwords, the default credentials
                        for accessing a web-based interface should not be the
                        same across all devices.
                        This is particularly true if the interface is enabled
                        by default as it can be assumed that many end-users
                        will not change the credentials.

                        Ensure you can update the software on the device to
                        mitigate vulnerabilities discovered in the future.
                        This consideration especially applies when your

                        When creating a new project, the default is to provide you
                        with an initial <filename>local.conf</filename> file that
                        enables this feature using the

                        Among other things, leaving this in place sets the

                        debugging or inspection easy during

                        add (e.g. administrative or service type users).
                        When you set up passwords for multiple images or

                        class, which is the preferred method.
                        For an example on how to set up both root and user
                        passwords, see the

                            When adding extra user accounts or setting a
                            root password, be cautious about setting the
                            same password on every device.
                            If you do this, and the password you have set
                            is exposed, then every device is now potentially
                            compromised.
                            If you need this access but want to ensure
                            security, consider setting a different,
                            random password for each device.
                            Typically, you do this as a separate step after
                            you deploy the image onto the device.

        <title>Creating Your Own Distribution</title>

        <para>
            When you build an image using the Yocto Project and
            do not alter any distribution
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>,
            you are creating a Poky distribution.
            If you wish to gain more control over package alternative
            selections, compile-time options, and other low-level
            configurations, you can create your own distribution.
        </para>

        <para>
            To create your own distribution, the basic steps consist of
            creating your own distribution layer, creating your own
            distribution configuration file, and then adding any needed
            code and Metadata to the layer.
            The following steps provide some more detail:

                    Create your distribution layer so that you can keep your
                    Metadata and code for the distribution separate.
                    It is strongly recommended that you create and use your own
                    layer for configuration and code.
                    Using your own layer as compared to just placing
                    configurations in a <filename>local.conf</filename>
                    configuration file makes it easier to reproduce the same
                    build configuration when using multiple build machines.
                    See the

                <listitem><para><emphasis>Create the distribution configuration file:</emphasis>
                    The distribution configuration file needs to be created in
                    the <filename>conf/distro</filename> directory of your
                    layer.
                    You need to name it using your distribution name
                    (e.g. <filename>mydistro.conf</filename>).

                        variable in your
                        <filename>local.conf</filename> file determines the
                        name of your distribution.
                    </note></para>
                    <para>You can split out parts of your configuration file
                    into include files and then "require" them from within
                    your distribution configuration file.
                    Be sure to place the include files in the
                    <filename>conf/distro/include</filename> directory of
                    your layer.
                    A common example usage of include files would be to
                    separate out the selection of desired version and revisions
                    for individual recipes.
</para>
                    <para>Your configuration file needs to set the following
                    required variables:

                    </literallayout>
                    These following variables are optional and you typically
                    set them from the distribution configuration file:

                        If you want to base your distribution configuration file
                        on the very basic configuration from OE-Core, you
                        can use
                        <filename>conf/distro/defaultsetup.conf</filename> as
                        a reference and just include variables that differ
                        as compared to <filename>defaultsetup.conf</filename>.
                        Alternatively, you can create a distribution
                        configuration file from scratch using the
                        <filename>defaultsetup.conf</filename> file
                        or configuration files from other distributions

        <title>Creating a Custom Template Configuration Directory</title>

        <para>
            If you are producing your own customized version
            of the build system for use by other users, you might
            want to customize the message shown by the setup script or
            you might want to change the template configuration files (i.e.
            <filename>local.conf</filename> and
            <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>) that are created in
            a new build directory.
        </para>

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system uses the environment variable
            <filename>TEMPLATECONF</filename> to locate the directory
            from which it gathers configuration information that ultimately
            ends up in the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
            <filename>conf</filename> directory.
            By default, <filename>TEMPLATECONF</filename> is set as
            follows in the <filename>poky</filename> repository:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     TEMPLATECONF=${TEMPLATECONF:-meta-poky/conf}
            </literallayout>
            This is the directory used by the build system to find templates
            from which to build some key configuration files.
            If you look at this directory, you will see the
            <filename>bblayers.conf.sample</filename>,
            <filename>local.conf.sample</filename>, and
            <filename>conf-notes.txt</filename> files.
            The build system uses these files to form the respective
            <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file,
            <filename>local.conf</filename> file, and display the list of
            BitBake targets when running the setup script.
        </para>

        <para>
            To override these default configuration files with
            configurations you want used within every new
            Build Directory, simply set the
            <filename>TEMPLATECONF</filename> variable to your directory.
            The <filename>TEMPLATECONF</filename> variable is set in the
            <filename>.templateconf</filename> file, which is in the
            top-level
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
            folder (e.g. <filename>poky</filename>).
            Edit the <filename>.templateconf</filename> so that it can locate
            your directory.
        </para>

        <para>
            Best practices dictate that you should keep your
            template configuration directory in your custom distribution layer.
            For example, suppose you have a layer named
            <filename>meta-mylayer</filename> located in your home directory
            and you want your template configuration directory named
            <filename>myconf</filename>.
            Changing the <filename>.templateconf</filename> as follows
            causes the OpenEmbedded build system to look in your directory
            and base its configuration files on the
            <filename>*.sample</filename> configuration files it finds.
            The final configuration files (i.e.
            <filename>local.conf</filename> and
            <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> ultimately still end up in
            your Build Directory, but they are based on your
            <filename>*.sample</filename> files.
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     TEMPLATECONF=${TEMPLATECONF:-meta-mylayer/myconf}
            </literallayout>
        </para>

        <para>
            Aside from the <filename>*.sample</filename> configuration files,
            the <filename>conf-notes.txt</filename> also resides in the
            default <filename>meta-poky/conf</filename> directory.
            The script that sets up the build environment
            (i.e.
            <ulink url="&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-core-script"><filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename></ulink>)
            uses this file to display BitBake targets as part of the script
            output.
            Customizing this <filename>conf-notes.txt</filename> file is a
            good way to make sure your list of custom targets appears
            as part of the script's output.
        </para>

        <para>
            Here is the default list of targets displayed as a result of
            running either of the setup scripts:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     You can now run 'bitbake &lt;target&gt;'

     Common targets are:
         core-image-minimal
         core-image-sato
         meta-toolchain
         meta-ide-support
            </literallayout>
        </para>

        <para>
            Changing the listed common targets is as easy as editing your
            version of <filename>conf-notes.txt</filename> in your
            custom template configuration directory and making sure you
            have <filename>TEMPLATECONF</filename> set to your directory.

                It is easiest to have something to start with when creating
                your own distribution.
                You can use the Yocto Project out-of-the-box to create the
                <filename>poky-tiny</filename> distribution.
                Ultimately, you will want to make changes in your own
                distribution that are likely modeled after
                <filename>poky-tiny</filename>.
                <note>
                    To use <filename>poky-tiny</filename> in your build,
                    set the

                Understanding some memory concepts will help you reduce the
                system size.
                Memory consists of static, dynamic, and temporary memory.
                Static memory is the TEXT (code), DATA (initialized data
                in the code), and BSS (uninitialized data) sections.
                Dynamic memory represents memory that is allocated at runtime:
                stacks, hash tables, and so forth.
                Temporary memory is recovered after the boot process.
                This memory consists of memory used for decompressing
                the kernel and for the <filename>__init__</filename>
                functions.

                        With this tool, you can merge individual configuration
                        fragments together.
                        The tool allows you to make overrides and warns you
                        of any missing configuration options.
                        The tool is ideal for allowing you to iterate on
                        configurations, create minimal configurations, and
                        create configuration files for different machines

            <title>Trim the Root Filesystem</title>

            <para>
                The root filesystem is made up of packages for booting,
                libraries, and applications.
                To change things, you can configure how the packaging happens,
                which changes the way you build them.
                You can also modify the filesystem itself or select a different
                filesystem.
            </para>

            <para>
                First, find out what is hogging your root filesystem by running the
                <filename>dirsize.py</filename> script from your root directory:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd <replaceable>root-directory-of-image</replaceable>
     $ dirsize.py 100000 > dirsize-100k.log
     $ cat dirsize-100k.log
                </literallayout>
                You can apply a filter to the script to ignore files under
                a certain size.
                The previous example filters out any files below 100 Kbytes.
                The sizes reported by the tool are uncompressed, and thus
                will be smaller by a relatively constant factor in a
                compressed root filesystem.
                When you examine your log file, you can focus on areas of the
                root filesystem that take up large amounts of memory.
            </para>

            <para>
                You need to be sure that what you eliminate does not cripple
                the functionality you need.
                One way to see how packages relate to each other is by using
                the Dependency Explorer UI with the BitBake command:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd <replaceable>image-directory</replaceable>
     $ bitbake -u taskexp -g <replaceable>image</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
                Use the interface to select potential packages you wish to
                eliminate and see their dependency relationships.
            </para>

            <para>
                When deciding how to reduce the size, get rid of packages that
                result in minimal impact on the feature set.
                For example, you might not need a VGA display.
                Or, you might be able to get by with <filename>devtmpfs</filename>
                and <filename>mdev</filename> instead of
                <filename>udev</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Use your <filename>local.conf</filename> file to make changes.
                For example, to eliminate <filename>udev</filename> and
                <filename>glib</filename>, set the following in the
                local configuration file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_dev_manager = ""
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Finally, you should consider exactly the type of root
                filesystem you need to meet your needs while also reducing
                its size.
                For example, consider <filename>cramfs</filename>,
                <filename>squashfs</filename>, <filename>ubifs</filename>,
                <filename>ext2</filename>, or an <filename>initramfs</filename>
                using <filename>initramfs</filename>.
                Be aware that <filename>ext3</filename> requires a 1 Mbyte
                journal.
                If you are okay with running read-only, you do not need this
                journal.
            </para>

            <note>
                After each round of elimination, you need to rebuild your
                system and then use the tools to see the effects of your
                reductions.

            <title>Trim the Kernel</title>

            <para>
                The kernel is built by including policies for hardware-independent
                aspects.
                What subsystems do you enable?
                For what architecture are you building?
                Which drivers do you build by default?
                <note>You can modify the kernel source if you want to help
                    with boot time.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Run the <filename>ksize.py</filename> script from the top-level
                Linux build directory to get an idea of what is making up
                the kernel:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd <replaceable>top-level-linux-build-directory</replaceable>
     $ ksize.py > ksize.log
     $ cat ksize.log
                </literallayout>
                When you examine the log, you will see how much space is
                taken up with the built-in <filename>.o</filename> files for
                drivers, networking, core kernel files, filesystem, sound,
                and so forth.
                The sizes reported by the tool are uncompressed, and thus
                will be smaller by a relatively constant factor in a compressed
                kernel image.
                Look to reduce the areas that are large and taking up around
                the "90% rule."
            </para>

            <para>
                To examine, or drill down, into any particular area, use the
                <filename>-d</filename> option with the script:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ ksize.py -d > ksize.log
                </literallayout>
                Using this option breaks out the individual file information
                for each area of the kernel (e.g. drivers, networking, and
                so forth).
            </para>

            <para>
                Use your log file to see what you can eliminate from the kernel
                based on features you can let go.
                For example, if you are not going to need sound, you do not
                need any drivers that support sound.
            </para>

            <para>
                After figuring out what to eliminate, you need to reconfigure
                the kernel to reflect those changes during the next build.
                You could run <filename>menuconfig</filename> and make all your
                changes at once.
                However, that makes it difficult to see the effects of your
                individual eliminations and also makes it difficult to replicate
                the changes for perhaps another target device.
                A better method is to start with no configurations using
                <filename>allnoconfig</filename>, create configuration
                fragments for individual changes, and then manage the
                fragments into a single configuration file using
                <filename>merge_config.sh</filename>.
                The tool makes it easy for you to iterate using the
                configuration change and build cycle.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each time you make configuration changes, you need to rebuild
                the kernel and check to see what impact your changes had on
                the overall size.

                Packaging requirements add size to the image.
                One way to reduce the size of the image is to remove all the
                packaging requirements from the image.
                This reduction includes both removing the package manager
                and its unique dependencies as well as removing the package
                management data itself.
            </para>

            <para>
                To eliminate all the packaging requirements for an image,

                        You need to be sure to integrate configuration fragments
                        into Busybox because BusyBox handles its own core

        <title>Building Images for More than One Machine</title>

        <para>
            A common scenario developers face is creating images for several
            different machines that use the same software environment.
            In this situation, it is tempting to set the
            tunings and optimization flags for each build specifically for
            the targeted hardware (i.e. "maxing out" the tunings).
            Doing so can considerably add to build times and package feed
            maintenance collectively for the machines.
            For example, selecting tunes that are extremely specific to a
            CPU core used in a system might enable some micro optimizations
            in GCC for that particular system but would otherwise not gain
            you much of a performance difference across the other systems
            as compared to using a more general tuning across all the builds
            (e.g. setting
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEFAULTTUNE'><filename>DEFAULTTUNE</filename></ulink>
            specifically for each machine's build).
            Rather than "max out" each build's tunings, you can take steps that
            cause the OpenEmbedded build system to reuse software across the
            various machines where it makes sense.
        </para>
        <para>
            If build speed and package feed maintenance are considerations,
            you should consider the points in this section that can help you
            optimize your tunings to best consider build times and package
            feed maintenance.

                    This practice is well supported and regularly used by
                    developers when building for multiple machines.
                    When you use the same <filename>TMPDIR</filename> for
                    multiple machine builds, the OpenEmbedded build system can
                    reuse the existing native and often cross-recipes for
                    multiple machines.
                    Thus, build time decreases.

                    By default, the OpenEmbedded build system enables three
                    levels of package architectures: "all", "tune" or "package",
                    and "machine".
                    Any given recipe usually selects one of these package
                    architectures (types) for its output.
                    Depending for what a given recipe creates packages, making
                    sure you enable the appropriate package architecture can
                    directly impact the build time.</para>
                    <para>A recipe that just generates scripts can enable
                    "all" architecture because there are no binaries to build.
                    To specifically enable "all" architecture, be sure your
                    recipe inherits the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-allarch'><filename>allarch</filename></ulink>
                    class.
                    This class is useful for "all" architectures because it
                    configures many variables so packages can be used across
                    multiple architectures.</para>
                    <para>If your recipe needs to generate packages that are

                    which makes your recipe also machine-architecture dependent,

                    Some tunes are more generic and can run on multiple targets

                    run on <filename>armv6</filename> and
                    <filename>armv7</filename> processors in most cases).
                    Similarly, <filename>i486</filename> binaries could work
                    on <filename>i586</filename> and higher processors.
                    You should realize, however, that advances on newer

                    Realize that even though a new sysroot for each machine is

                <listitem><para><emphasis>Manage Granular Level Packaging:</emphasis>
                    Sometimes cases exist where injecting another level
                    of package architecture beyond the three higher levels
                    noted earlier can be useful.
                    For example, consider the <filename>emgd</filename>
                    graphics stack in the
                    <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer.
                    In this layer, a subset of software exists that is
                    compiled against something different from the rest of the
                    generic packages.
                    You can examine the key code in the
                    <ulink url='http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi'>Source Repositories</ulink>
                    "daisy" branch in
                    <filename>classes/emgd-gl.bbclass</filename>.
                    For a specific set of packages, the code redefines
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_ARCH'><filename>PACKAGE_ARCH</filename></ulink>.
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS'><filename>PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS</filename></ulink>
                    is then appended with this extra tune name in
                    <filename>meta-intel-emgd.inc</filename>.
                    The result is that when searching for packages, the
                    build system uses a four-level search and the packages
                    in this new level are preferred as compared to the standard
                    tune.
                    The overall result is that the build system reuses most
                    software from the common tune except for specific cases
                    as needed.

                    Sometimes you can run into situations where software is
                    being rebuilt when you think it should not be.
                    For example, the OpenEmbedded build system might not be

                    should be.
                    These types of situations are usually due to references
                    to machine-specific variables such as

                You might find it necessary to prevent specific packages
                from being installed into an image.
                If so, you can use several variables to direct the build
                system to essentially ignore installing recommended packages
                or to not install a package at all.

                The following list introduces variables you can use to
                prevent packages from being installed into your image.
                Each of these variables only works with IPK and RPM
                package types.
                Support for Debian packages does not exist.
                Also, you can use these variables from your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file or attach them to a
                specific image recipe by using a recipe name override.
                For more detail on the variables, see the descriptions in the

            <para>
                This section provides some background on how binary package
                versioning is accomplished and presents some of the services,
                variables, and terminology involved.

            <para>
                In order to understand binary package versioning, you need
                to consider the following:

                        Binary Package Version:  The binary package version
                        is composed of two components - a version and a
                        revision.
                        <note>
                            Technically, a third component, the "epoch" (i.e.

                            is involved but this discussion for the most part
                            ignores <filename>PE</filename>.
                        </note>
                        The version and revision are taken from the

                Whenever the binary package content changes, the binary package
                version must change.
                Changing the binary package version is accomplished by changing
                or "bumping" the <filename>PR</filename> and/or
                <filename>PV</filename> values.
                Increasing these values occurs one of two ways:

                Given a primary challenge of any build system and its users
                is how to maintain a package feed that is compatible with
                existing package manager applications such as RPM, APT, and
                OPKG, using an automated system is much preferred over a
                manual system.
                In either system, the main requirement is that binary package
                version numbering increases in a linear fashion and that a
                number of version components exist that support that linear
                progression.
                For information on how to ensure package revisioning remains
                linear, see the

                The following three sections provide related information on the
                PR Service, the manual method for "bumping"
                <filename>PR</filename> and/or <filename>PV</filename>, and
                on how to ensure binary package revisioning remains linear.

                    As mentioned, attempting to maintain revision numbers in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>
                    is error prone, inaccurate, and causes problems for people
                    submitting recipes.
                    Conversely, the PR Service automatically generates
                    increasing numbers, particularly the revision field,
                    which removes the human element.
                    <note>
                        For additional information on using a PR Service, you
                        can see the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_WIKI_URL;/wiki/PR_Service'>PR Service</ulink>
                        wiki page.
                    </note>
                </para>

                <para>
                    The Yocto Project uses variables in order of
                    decreasing priority to facilitate revision numbering (i.e.
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PE'><filename>PE</filename></ulink>,
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>, and
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>
                    for epoch, version, and revision, respectively).
                    The values are highly dependent on the policies and
                    procedures of a given distribution and package feed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Because the OpenEmbedded build system uses
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#checksums'>signatures</ulink>",
                    which are unique to a given build, the build system
                    knows when to rebuild packages.
                    All the inputs into a given task are represented by a
                    signature, which can trigger a rebuild when different.
                    Thus, the build system itself does not rely on the
                    <filename>PR</filename>, <filename>PV</filename>, and
                    <filename>PE</filename> numbers to trigger a rebuild.
                    The signatures, however, can be used to generate
                    these values.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The PR Service works with both
                    <filename>OEBasic</filename> and
                    <filename>OEBasicHash</filename> generators.
                    The value of <filename>PR</filename> bumps when the
                    checksum changes and the different generator mechanisms
                    change signatures under different circumstances.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As implemented, the build system includes values from
                    the PR Service into the <filename>PR</filename> field as
                    an addition using the form "<filename>.x</filename>" so
                    <filename>r0</filename> becomes <filename>r0.1</filename>,
                    <filename>r0.2</filename> and so forth.
                    This scheme allows existing <filename>PR</filename> values
                    to be used for whatever reasons, which include manual
                    <filename>PR</filename> bumps, should it be necessary.
                </para>

                <para>
                    By default, the PR Service is not enabled or running.
                    Thus, the packages generated are just "self consistent".
                    The build system adds and removes packages and
                    there are no guarantees about upgrade paths but images
                    will be consistent and correct with the latest changes.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The simplest form for a PR Service is for it to exist
                    for a single host development system that builds the
                    package feed (building system).
                    For this scenario, you can enable a local PR Service by
                    setting
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PRSERV_HOST'><filename>PRSERV_HOST</filename></ulink>
                    in your <filename>local.conf</filename> file in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PRSERV_HOST = "localhost:0"
                    </literallayout>
                    Once the service is started, packages will automatically
                    get increasing <filename>PR</filename> values and
                    BitBake takes care of starting and stopping the server.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you have a more complex setup where multiple host
                    development systems work against a common, shared package
                    feed, you have a single PR Service running and it is
                    connected to each building system.
                    For this scenario, you need to start the PR Service using
                    the <filename>bitbake-prserv</filename> command:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     bitbake-prserv --host <replaceable>ip</replaceable> --port <replaceable>port</replaceable> --start
                    </literallayout>
                    In addition to hand-starting the service, you need to
                    update the <filename>local.conf</filename> file of each
                    building system as described earlier so each system
                    points to the server and port.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is also recommended you use build history, which adds
                    some sanity checks to binary package versions, in
                    conjunction with the server that is running the PR Service.
                    To enable build history, add the following to each building
                    system's <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # It is recommended to activate "buildhistory" for testing the PR service
     INHERIT += "buildhistory"
     BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = "1"
                    </literallayout>
                    For information on build history, see the
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#maintaining-build-output-quality'>Maintaining Build Output Quality</ulink>"
                    section in the Yocto Project Reference Manual.
                </para>

                <note>
                    <para>
                        The OpenEmbedded build system does not maintain
                        <filename>PR</filename> information as part of the
                        shared state (sstate) packages.
                        If you maintain an sstate feed, its expected that either
                        all your building systems that contribute to the sstate
                         feed use a shared PR Service, or you do not run a PR
                        Service on any of your building systems.
                        Having some systems use a PR Service while others do
                        not leads to obvious problems.

                <title>Manually Bumping PR</title>

                <para>
                    The alternative to setting up a PR Service is to manually
                    "bump" the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a committed change results in changing the package
                    output, then the value of the PR variable needs to be
                    increased (or "bumped") as part of that commit.
                    For new recipes you should add the <filename>PR</filename>
                    variable and set its initial value equal to "r0", which is
                    the default.
                    Even though the default value is "r0", the practice of
                    adding it to a new recipe makes it harder to forget to bump
                    the variable when you make changes to the recipe in future.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you are sharing a common <filename>.inc</filename> file
                    with multiple recipes, you can also use the
                    <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-INC_PR'>INC_PR</ulink></filename>
                    variable to ensure that the recipes sharing the
                    <filename>.inc</filename> file are rebuilt when the
                    <filename>.inc</filename> file itself is changed.
                    The <filename>.inc</filename> file must set
                    <filename>INC_PR</filename> (initially to "r0"), and all
                    recipes referring to it should set <filename>PR</filename>
                    to "${INC_PR}.0" initially, incrementing the last number
                    when the recipe is changed.
                    If the <filename>.inc</filename> file is changed then its
                    <filename>INC_PR</filename> should be incremented.
                </para>

                <para>
                    When upgrading the version of a binary package, assuming the
                    <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'>PV</ulink></filename>
                    changes, the <filename>PR</filename> variable should be
                    reset to "r0" (or "${INC_PR}.0" if you are using
                    <filename>INC_PR</filename>).
                </para>

                <para>
                    Usually, version increases occur only to binary packages.
                    However, if for some reason <filename>PV</filename> changes
                    but does not increase, you can increase the
                    <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PE'>PE</ulink></filename>
                    variable (Package Epoch).
                    The <filename>PE</filename> variable defaults to "0".

                <para>
                    When fetching a repository, BitBake uses the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRCREV'><filename>SRCREV</filename></ulink>
                    variable to determine the specific source code revision
                    from which to build.
                    You set the <filename>SRCREV</filename> variable to
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-AUTOREV'><filename>AUTOREV</filename></ulink>
                    to cause the OpenEmbedded build system to automatically use the
                    latest revision of the software:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRCREV = "${AUTOREV}"
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    Furthermore, you need to reference <filename>SRCPV</filename>
                    in <filename>PV</filename> in order to automatically update
                    the version whenever the revision of the source code
                    changes.
                    Here is an example:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PV = "1.0+git${SRCPV}"
                    </literallayout>
                    The OpenEmbedded build system substitutes
                    <filename>SRCPV</filename> with the following:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     AUTOINC+<replaceable>source_code_revision</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    The build system replaces the <filename>AUTOINC</filename> with
                    a number.
                    The number used depends on the state of the PR Service:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para>
                            If PR Service is enabled, the build system increments
                            the number, which is similar to the behavior of
                            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>.
                            This behavior results in linearly increasing package
                            versions, which is desirable.
                            Here is an example:
                            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     hello-world-git_0.0+git0+b6558dd387-r0.0_armv7a-neon.ipk
     hello-world-git_0.0+git1+dd2f5c3565-r0.0_armv7a-neon.ipk
                            </literallayout>
                            </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para>
                            If PR Service is not enabled, the build system
                            replaces the <filename>AUTOINC</filename>
                            placeholder with zero (i.e. "0").
                            This results in changing the package version since
                            the source revision is included.
                            However, package versions are not increased linearly.
                            Here is an example:
                            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     hello-world-git_0.0+git0+b6558dd387-r0.0_armv7a-neon.ipk
     hello-world-git_0.0+git0+dd2f5c3565-r0.0_armv7a-neon.ipk

                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>

                <para>
                    In summary, the OpenEmbedded build system does not track the
                    history of binary package versions for this purpose.
                    <filename>AUTOINC</filename>, in this case, is comparable to
                    <filename>PR</filename>.
                    If PR server is not enabled, <filename>AUTOINC</filename>
                    in the package version is simply replaced by "0".
                    If PR server is enabled, the build system keeps track of the
                    package versions and bumps the number when the package
                    revision changes.

            <title>Handling Optional Module Packaging</title>

            <para>
                Many pieces of software split functionality into optional
                modules (or plug-ins) and the plug-ins that are built
                might depend on configuration options.
                To avoid having to duplicate the logic that determines what
                modules are available in your recipe or to avoid having
                to package each module by hand, the OpenEmbedded build system
                provides functionality to handle module packaging dynamically.
            </para>

            <para>
                To handle optional module packaging, you need to do two things:

                <para>
                    To ensure the module packaging actually gets done, you use
                    the <filename>do_split_packages</filename> function within
                    the <filename>populate_packages</filename> Python function
                    in your recipe.
                    The <filename>do_split_packages</filename> function
                    searches for a pattern of files or directories under a
                    specified path and creates a package for each one it finds
                    by appending to the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGES'><filename>PACKAGES</filename></ulink>
                    variable and setting the appropriate values for
                    <filename>FILES_packagename</filename>,
                    <filename>RDEPENDS_packagename</filename>,
                    <filename>DESCRIPTION_packagename</filename>, and so forth.
                    Here is an example from the <filename>lighttpd</filename>
                    recipe:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     python populate_packages_prepend () {
         lighttpd_libdir = d.expand('${libdir}')
         do_split_packages(d, lighttpd_libdir, '^mod_(.*)\.so$',
                          'lighttpd-module-%s', 'Lighttpd module for %s',
                           extra_depends='')
     }
                    </literallayout>
                    The previous example specifies a number of things in the

                    Often, packaging modules is as simple as the previous
                    example.
                    However, more advanced options exist that you can use
                    within <filename>do_split_packages</filename> to modify its
                    behavior.
                    And, if you need to, you can add more logic by specifying
                    a hook function that is called for each package.
                    It is also perfectly acceptable to call
                    <filename>do_split_packages</filename> multiple times if
                    you have more than one set of modules to package.

     Mandatory arguments

     root
        The path in which to search
     file_regex
        Regular expression to match searched files.
        Use parentheses () to mark the part of this
        expression that should be used to derive the
        module name (to be substituted where %s is
        used in other function arguments as noted below)
     output_pattern
        Pattern to use for the package names. Must
        include %s.
     description
        Description to set for each package. Must
        include %s.

     Optional arguments

     postinst
        Postinstall script to use for all packages
        (as a string)
     recursive
        True to perform a recursive search - default
        False
     hook
        A hook function to be called for every match.
        The function will be called with the following
        arguments (in the order listed):

        f
           Full path to the file/directory match
        pkg
           The package name
        file_regex
           As above
        output_pattern
           As above
        modulename
           The module name derived using file_regex

     extra_depends
        Extra runtime dependencies (RDEPENDS) to be
        set for all packages. The default value of None
        causes a dependency on the main package
        (${PN}) - if you do not want this, pass empty
        string '' for this parameter.
     aux_files_pattern
        Extra item(s) to be added to FILES for each
        package. Can be a single string item or a list
        of strings for multiple items. Must include %s.
     postrm
        postrm script to use for all packages (as a
        string)
     allow_dirs
        True to allow directories to be matched -
        default False
     prepend
        If True, prepend created packages to PACKAGES
        instead of the default False which appends them
     match_path
        match file_regex on the whole relative path to
        the root rather than just the file name
     aux_files_pattern_verbatim
        Extra item(s) to be added to FILES for each
        package, using the actual derived module name
        rather than converting it to something legal
        for a package name. Can be a single string item
        or a list of strings for multiple items. Must
        include %s.
     allow_links
        True to allow symlinks to be matched - default
        False
     summary
        Summary to set for each package. Must include %s;
        defaults to description if not set.

                <para>
                    The second part for handling optional module packaging
                    is to ensure that any dependencies on optional modules
                    from other recipes are satisfied by your recipe.
                    You can be sure these dependencies are satisfied by
                    using the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGES_DYNAMIC'><filename>PACKAGES_DYNAMIC</filename></ulink> variable.
                    Here is an example that continues with the

                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGES_DYNAMIC = "lighttpd-module-.*"
                    </literallayout>
                    The name specified in the regular expression can of
                    course be anything.
                    In this example, it is <filename>lighttpd-module-</filename>
                    and is specified as the prefix to ensure that any
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                    and <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RRECOMMENDS'><filename>RRECOMMENDS</filename></ulink>
                    on a package name starting with the prefix are satisfied
                    during build time.
                    If you are using <filename>do_split_packages</filename>
                    as described in the previous section, the value you put in
                    <filename>PACKAGES_DYNAMIC</filename> should correspond to
                    the name pattern specified in the call to

            <para>
                In all these situations, you have something similar to a more
                traditional Linux distribution in that in-field devices
                are able to receive pre-compiled packages from a server for
                installation or update.
                Being able to install these packages on a running,
                in-field device is what is termed "runtime package
                management".
            </para>

            <para>
                In order to use runtime package management, you
                need a host/server machine that serves up the pre-compiled
                packages plus the required metadata.
                You also need package manipulation tools on the target.
                The build machine is a likely candidate to act as the server.
                However, that machine does not necessarily have to be the
                package server.
                The build machine could push its artifacts to another machine
                that acts as the server (e.g. Internet-facing).
            </para>

            <para>
                A simple build that targets just one device produces
                more than one package database.
                In other words, the packages produced by a build are separated
                out into a couple of different package groupings based on
                criteria such as the target's CPU architecture, the target
                board, or the C library used on the target.
                For example, a build targeting the <filename>qemuarm</filename>
                device produces the following three package databases:
                <filename>all</filename>, <filename>armv5te</filename>, and
                <filename>qemuarm</filename>.
                If you wanted your <filename>qemuarm</filename> device to be
                aware of all the packages that were available to it,
                you would need to point it to each of these databases
                individually.
                In a similar way, a traditional Linux distribution usually is
                configured to be aware of a number of software repositories
                from which it retrieves packages.
            </para>

            <para>
                Using runtime package management is completely optional and
                not required for a successful build or deployment in any
                way.
                But if you want to make use of runtime package management,
                you need to do a couple things above and beyond the basics.
                The remainder of this section describes what you need to do.

                    When BitBake generates packages, it needs to know
                    what format or formats to use.
                    In your configuration, you use the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES'><filename>PACKAGE_CLASSES</filename></ulink>
                    variable to specify the format:

                        <listitem><para>
                            Select the desired package format as follows:
                            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= “package_<replaceable>packageformat</replaceable>”
                            </literallayout>
                            where <replaceable>packageformat</replaceable>
                            can be "ipk", "rpm", and "deb", which are the
                            supported package formats.
                            <note>
                                Because the Yocto Project supports three
                                different package formats, you can set the
                                variable with more than one argument.
                                However, the OpenEmbedded build system only
                                uses the first argument when creating an image
                                or Software Development Kit (SDK).
                            </note>

                </para>

                <para>
                    If you would like your image to start off with a basic
                    package database containing the packages in your current
                    build as well as to have the relevant tools available on the
                    target for runtime package management, you can include
                    "package-management" in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                    Including "package-management" in this
                    configuration variable ensures that when the image
                    is assembled for your target, the image includes
                    the currently-known package databases as well as
                    the target-specific tools required for runtime
                    package management to be performed on the target.
                    However, this is not strictly necessary.
                    You could start your image off without any databases
                    but only include the required on-target package
                    tool(s).
                    As an example, you could include "opkg" in your
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'><filename>IMAGE_INSTALL</filename></ulink>
                    variable if you are using the IPK package format.
                    You can then initialize your target's package database(s)
                    later once your image is up and running.

                <para>
                    Whenever you perform any sort of build step that can
                    potentially generate a package or modify an existing
                    package, it is always a good idea to re-generate the
                    package index with:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
    $ bitbake package-index
                    </literallayout>
                    Realize that it is not sufficient to simply do the
                    following:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
    $ bitbake <replaceable>some-package</replaceable> package-index
                    </literallayout>
                    The reason for this restriction is because BitBake does not
                    properly schedule the <filename>package-index</filename>
                    target fully after any other target has completed.
                    Thus, be sure to run the package update step separately.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can use the

                    variables to pre-configure target images to use a package
                    feed.
                    If you do not define these variables, then manual steps
                    as described in the subsequent sections are necessary to
                    configure the target.
                    You should set these variables before building the image
                    in order to produce a correctly configured image.

                    directory.

                    Although other protocols are possible, a server using HTTP
                    typically serves packages.
                    If you want to use HTTP, then set up and configure a
                    web server such as Apache 2, lighttpd, or
                    SimpleHTTPServer on the machine serving the packages.

                <para>
                    To keep things simple, this section describes how to set
                    up a SimpleHTTPServer web server to share package feeds
                    from the developer's machine.
                    Although this server might not be the best for a production
                    environment, the setup is simple and straight forward.
                    Should you want to use a different server more suited for
                    production (e.g. Apache 2, Lighttpd, or Nginx), take the
                    appropriate steps to do so.

                Once a signature is verified, the OpenEmbedded build system

                If security fails for a signed package, the build system

                by the OpenEmbedded build system on the target machine.
                A ptest contains at least two items: the actual test, and
                a shell script (<filename>run-ptest</filename>) that starts
                the test.
                The shell script that starts the test must not contain
                the actual test - the script only starts the test.
                On the other hand, the test can be anything from a simple
                shell script that runs a binary and checks the output to
                an elaborate system of test binaries and data files.

                            Not many packages support cross-compilation of
                            their test suites.
                            Consequently, you usually need to add a
                            cross-compilation function to the package.

                            <para>Many packages based on Automake compile and
                            run the test suite by using a single command
                            such as <filename>make check</filename>.
                            However, the host <filename>make check</filename>
                            builds and runs on the same computer, while
                            cross-compiling requires that the package is built
                            on the host but executed for the target
                            architecture (though often, as in the case for

                            The built version of Automake that ships with the

                            building and execution.
                            Consequently, packages that use the unaltered,

        <title>Working with Source Files</title>

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system works with source files located
            through the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
            variable.
            When you build something using BitBake, a big part of the operation
            is locating and downloading all the source tarballs.
            For images, downloading all the source for various packages can
            take a significant amount of time.
        </para>

        <para>
            This section presents information for working with source

            <title>Setting up Effective Mirrors</title>

            <para>
                As mentioned, a good deal that goes into a Yocto Project
                build is simply downloading all of the source tarballs.
                Maybe you have been working with another build system
                (OpenEmbedded or Angstrom) for which you have built up a
                sizable directory of source tarballs.
                Or, perhaps someone else has such a directory for which you
                have read access.
                If so, you can save time by adding statements to your
                configuration file so that the build process checks local
                directories first for existing tarballs before checking the
                Internet.
            </para>

            <para>
                Here is an efficient way to set it up in your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SOURCE_MIRROR_URL ?= "file:///home/you/your-download-dir/"
     INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
     BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"
     # BB_NO_NETWORK = "1"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                In the previous example, the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS'><filename>BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS</filename></ulink>
                variable causes the OpenEmbedded build system to generate
                tarballs of the Git repositories and store them in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>
                directory.
                Due to performance reasons, generating and storing these
                tarballs is not the build system's default behavior.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can also use the

                variable.

            <para>
                Another technique you can use to ready yourself for a
                successive string of build operations, is to pre-fetch
                all the source files without actually starting a build.
                This technique lets you work through any download issues
                and ultimately gathers all the source files into your
                download directory
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-build-downloads'><filename>build/downloads</filename></ulink>,
                which is located with
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Use the following BitBake command form to fetch all the
                necessary sources without starting the build:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -c fetchall <replaceable>target</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
                This variation of the BitBake command guarantees that you
                have all the sources for that BitBake target should you
                disconnect from the Internet and want to do the build
                later offline.

        <title>Building Software from an External Source</title>

        <para>
            By default, the OpenEmbedded build system uses the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
            when building source code.
            The build process involves fetching the source files, unpacking
            them, and then patching them if necessary before the build takes
            place.
        </para>

        <para>
            Situations exist where you might want to build software from source
            files that are external to and thus outside of the
            OpenEmbedded build system.
            For example, suppose you have a project that includes a new BSP with
            a heavily customized kernel.
            And, you want to minimize exposing the build system to the
            development team so that they can focus on their project and
            maintain everyone's workflow as much as possible.
            In this case, you want a kernel source directory on the development
            machine where the development occurs.
            You want the recipe's
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
            variable to point to the external directory and use it as is, not
            copy it.
        </para>

        <para>
            To build from software that comes from an external source, all you
            need to do is inherit the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-externalsrc'><filename>externalsrc</filename></ulink>
            class and then set the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-EXTERNALSRC'><filename>EXTERNALSRC</filename></ulink>
            variable to point to your external source code.
            Here are the statements to put in your
            <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     INHERIT += "externalsrc"
     EXTERNALSRC_pn-<replaceable>myrecipe</replaceable> = "<replaceable>path-to-your-source-tree</replaceable>"
            </literallayout>
        </para>

        <para>
            This next example shows how to accomplish the same thing by setting
            <filename>EXTERNALSRC</filename> in the recipe itself or in the
            recipe's append file:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     EXTERNALSRC = "<replaceable>path</replaceable>"
     EXTERNALSRC_BUILD = "<replaceable>path</replaceable>"
            </literallayout>
            <note>
                In order for these settings to take effect, you must globally
                or locally inherit the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-externalsrc'><filename>externalsrc</filename></ulink>
                class.
            </note>
        </para>

        <para>
            By default, <filename>externalsrc.bbclass</filename> builds
            the source code in a directory separate from the external source
            directory as specified by
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-EXTERNALSRC'><filename>EXTERNALSRC</filename></ulink>.
            If you need to have the source built in the same directory in
            which it resides, or some other nominated directory, you can set
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-EXTERNALSRC_BUILD'><filename>EXTERNALSRC_BUILD</filename></ulink>
            to point to that directory:

            By default, the Yocto Project uses SysVinit as the initialization
            manager.
            However, support also exists for systemd,
            which is a full replacement for init with
            parallel starting of services, reduced shell overhead and other

            If you want to use SysVinit, you do
            not have to do anything.

     DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"

        <title>Using an External SCM</title>

        <para>
            If you're working on a recipe that pulls from an external Source
            Code Manager (SCM), it is possible to have the OpenEmbedded build
            system notice new recipe changes added to the SCM and then build
            the resulting packages that depend on the new recipes by using
            the latest versions.
            This only works for SCMs from which it is possible to get a
            sensible revision number for changes.
            Currently, you can do this with Apache Subversion (SVN), Git, and
            Bazaar (BZR) repositories.
        </para>

        <para>
            To enable this behavior, the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>
            of the recipe needs to reference
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRCPV'><filename>SRCPV</filename></ulink>.
            Here is an example:

     PV = "1.2.3+git${SRCPV}"
            </literallayout>
            Then, you can add the following to your
            <filename>local.conf</filename>:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRCREV_pn-<replaceable>PN</replaceable> = "${AUTOREV}"

            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink>
            is the name of the recipe for which you want to enable automatic source
            revision updating.
        </para>

        <para>
            If you do not want to update your local configuration file, you can
            add the following directly to the recipe to finish enabling
            the feature:

        <title>Creating a Read-Only Root Filesystem</title>

        <para>
            Suppose, for security reasons, you need to disable
            your target device's root filesystem's write permissions
            (i.e. you need a read-only root filesystem).
            Or, perhaps you are running the device's operating system
            from a read-only storage device.
            For either case, you can customize your image for
            that behavior.
        </para>

        <note>
            Supporting a read-only root filesystem requires that the system and
            applications do not try to write to the root filesystem.
            You must configure all parts of the target system to write
            elsewhere, or to gracefully fail in the event of attempting to
            write to the root filesystem.

            <title>Post-Installation Scripts</title>

            <para>
                It is very important that you make sure all
                post-Installation (<filename>pkg_postinst</filename>) scripts
                for packages that are installed into the image can be run
                at the time when the root filesystem is created during the
                build on the host system.
                These scripts cannot attempt to run during first-boot on the
                target device.
                With the "read-only-rootfs" feature enabled,
                the build system checks during root filesystem creation to make
                sure all post-installation scripts succeed.
                If any of these scripts still need to be run after the root
                filesystem is created, the build immediately fails.
                These build-time checks ensure that the build fails
                rather than the target device fails later during its
                initial boot operation.
            </para>

            <para>
                Most of the common post-installation scripts generated by the
                build system for the out-of-the-box Yocto Project are engineered
                so that they can run during root filesystem creation
                (e.g. post-installation scripts for caching fonts).
                However, if you create and add custom scripts, you need
                to be sure they can be run during this file system creation.
            </para>

            <para>
                Here are some common problems that prevent
                post-installation scripts from running during root filesystem

                        script is run on the target device.
                        This implies two purposes for <filename>$D</filename>:
                        ensuring paths are valid in both the host and target
                        environments, and checking to determine which
                        environment is being used as a method for taking
                        appropriate actions.

                        You can work around these attempts by using native

            You can run these tests on either QEMU or actual target hardware.
            Tests are written in Python making use of the

                    For automated deployment, a "master image" is installed

                    Then, each time tests are to be run, the following

                    When running tests (independent of whether the image

                    expected to be connected to a network on a
                    pre-determined IP address.
                    You can either use static IP addresses written into
                    the image, or set the image to use DHCP and have your
                    DHCP server on the test network assign a known IP address
                    based on the MAC address of the device.

                            as a command that runs on the host and does power
                            cycling.
                            The test code passes one argument to that command:
                            off, on or cycle (off then on).
                            Here is an example that could appear in your
                            <filename>local.conf</filename> file:

                            In this example, the expect script does the
                            following:
                            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ssh test@10.11.12.1 "pyctl nuc1 <replaceable>arg</replaceable>"
                            </literallayout>
                            It then runs a Python script that controls power
                            for a label called <filename>nuc1</filename>.
                            <note>
                                You need to customize

                                The one requirement is that it accepts

                            to reboot the device.
                            Classic reboot is fine as long as the machine

                            It is useful for scenarios where you have a simple
                            setup, typically with a single board, and where
                            some manual interaction is okay from time to time.

                    For test target classes requiring a serial console
                    to interact with the bootloader (e.g. BeagleBoneTarget,
                    EdgeRouterTarget, and GrubTarget), you need to
                    specify a command to use to connect to the serial console
                    of the target machine by using the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TEST_SERIALCONTROL_CMD'><filename>TEST_SERIALCONTROL_CMD</filename></ulink>
                    variable and optionally the

                    These cases could be a serial terminal program if the
                    machine is connected to a local serial port, or a
                    <filename>telnet</filename> or
                    <filename>ssh</filename> command connecting to a remote
                    console server.
                    Regardless of the case, the command simply needs to
                    connect to the serial console and forward that connection
                    to standard input and output as any normal terminal
                    program does.
                    For example, to use the picocom terminal program on
                    serial device <filename>/dev/ttyUSB0</filename>
                    at 115200bps, you would set the variable as follows:

     TEST_SERIALCONTROL_CMD = "picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200"

                    For local devices where the serial port device disappears
                    when the device reboots, an additional "serdevtry" wrapper
                    script is provided.
                    To use this wrapper, simply prefix the terminal command
                    with
                    <filename>${COREBASE}/scripts/contrib/serdevtry</filename>:

                Tests are usually grouped together by the area
                tested (e.g tests for systemd reside in
                <filename>meta/lib/oeqa/runtime/systemd.py</filename>).
            </para>

            <para>
                You can add tests to any layer provided you place them in the
                proper area and you extend
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBPATH'><filename>BBPATH</filename></ulink>
                in the <filename>local.conf</filename> file as normal.
                Be sure that tests reside in
                <filename><replaceable>layer</replaceable>/lib/oeqa/runtime</filename>.
                <note>
                    Be sure that module names do not collide with module names
                    used in the default set of test modules in
                    <filename>meta/lib/oeqa/runtime</filename>.

            </para>

            <para>
                You can change the set of tests run by appending or overriding
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TEST_SUITES'><filename>TEST_SUITES</filename></ulink>
                variable in <filename>local.conf</filename>.
                Each name in <filename>TEST_SUITES</filename> represents a
                required test for the image.
                Test modules named within <filename>TEST_SUITES</filename>
                cannot be skipped even if a test is not suitable for an image
                (e.g. running the RPM tests on an image without
                <filename>rpm</filename>).
                Appending "auto" to <filename>TEST_SUITES</filename> causes the
                build system to try to run all tests that are suitable for the
                image (i.e. each test module may elect to skip itself).
            </para>

            <para>
                The order you list tests in <filename>TEST_SUITES</filename>
                is important and influences test dependencies.
                Consequently, tests that depend on other tests should be added
                after the test on which they depend.
                For example, since the <filename>ssh</filename> test
                depends on the
                <filename>ping</filename> test, "ssh" needs to come after
                "ping" in the list.
                The test class provides no re-ordering or dependency handling.
                <note>
                    Each module can have multiple classes with multiple test
                    methods.
                    And, Python <filename>unittest</filename> rules apply.

            <para>
                You can export tests so that they can run independently of
                the build system.
                Exporting tests is required if you want to be able to hand
                the test execution off to a scheduler.
                You can only export tests that are defined in
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TEST_SUITES'><filename>TEST_SUITES</filename></ulink>.
            </para>

                If your image is already built, make sure the following are set

                You can then export the tests with the following BitBake
                command form:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake <replaceable>image</replaceable> -c testexport
                </literallayout>
                Exporting the tests places them in the

                Use BitBake to export the tests:

                As mentioned previously, all new test files need to be in the
                proper place for the build system to find them.
                New tests for additional functionality outside of the core
                should be added to the layer that adds the functionality, in

                When a test requires a package built by BitBake, it is possible
                to install that package.
                Installing the package does not require a package manager be
                installed in the device under test (DUT).
                It does, however, require an SSH connection and the target must
                be using the <filename>sshcontrol</filename> class.
                <note>
                    This method uses <filename>scp</filename> to copy files

        <title>Debugging With the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) Remotely</title>

        <para>
            GDB allows you to examine running programs, which in turn helps you to understand and fix problems.
            It also allows you to perform post-mortem style analysis of program crashes.
            GDB is available as a package within the Yocto Project and is
            installed in SDK images by default.
            See the "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-images'>Images</ulink>" chapter
            in the Yocto Project Reference Manual for a description of these images.
            You can find information on GDB at <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/gdb/"/>.
        </para>

        <tip>
            For best results, install debug (<filename>-dbg</filename>) packages
            for the applications you are going to debug.
            Doing so makes extra debug symbols available that give you more
            meaningful output.
        </tip>

        <para>
            Sometimes, due to memory or disk space constraints, it is not possible
            to use GDB directly on the remote target to debug applications.
            These constraints arise because GDB needs to load the debugging information and the
            binaries of the process being debugged.
            Additionally, GDB needs to perform many computations to locate information such as function
            names, variable names and values, stack traces and so forth - even before starting the
            debugging process.
            These extra computations place more load on the target system and can alter the
            characteristics of the program being debugged.
        </para>

        <para>
            To help get past the previously mentioned constraints, you can use
            gdbserver, which runs on the remote target and does not load any
            debugging information from the debugged process.
            Instead, a GDB instance processes the debugging information that is run on a
            remote computer - the host GDB.
            The host GDB then sends control commands to gdbserver to make it stop or start the debugged
            program, as well as read or write memory regions of that debugged program.
            All the debugging information loaded and processed as well
            as all the heavy debugging is done by the host GDB.
            Offloading these processes gives the gdbserver running on the target a chance to remain
            small and fast.
        </para>

        <para>
            Because the host GDB is responsible for loading the debugging information and
            for doing the necessary processing to make actual debugging happen,
            you have to make sure the host can access the unstripped binaries complete
            with their debugging information and also be sure the target is compiled with no optimizations.
            The host GDB must also have local access to all the libraries used by the
            debugged program.
            Because gdbserver does not need any local debugging information, the binaries on
            the remote target can remain stripped.
            However, the binaries must also be compiled without optimization
            so they match the host's binaries.
        </para>

        <para>
            To remain consistent with GDB documentation and terminology, the binary being debugged
            on the remote target machine is referred to as the "inferior" binary.
            For documentation on GDB see the
            <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/">GDB site</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The following steps show you how to debug using the GNU project
            debugger.

                    <para>In your <filename>local.conf</filename> file, set
                    the following:

     IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS = "1"
     IMAGE_FSTYPES_DEBUGFS = "tar.bz2"

                    These options cause the OpenEmbedded build system
                    to generate a special companion filesystem fragment,
                    which contains the matching source and debug symbols to
                    your deployable filesystem.
                    The build system does this by looking at what is in the
                    deployed filesystem, and pulling the corresponding
                    <filename>-dbg</filename> packages.</para>

                    <para>The companion debug filesystem is not a complete
                    filesystem, but only contains the debug fragments.
                    This filesystem must be combined with the full filesystem
                    for debugging.
                    Subsequent steps in this procedure show how to combine
                    the partial filesystem with the full filesystem.

                    The change makes sure the <filename>gdbserver</filename>
                    package is included.

                <listitem><para>
                    <emphasis>Build the environment:</emphasis></para>

                    <para>Use the following command to construct the image and
                    the companion Debug Filesystem:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake <replaceable>image</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    Build the cross GDB component and make it available
                    for debugging.
                    Build the SDK that matches the image.
                    Building the SDK is best for a production build
                    that can be used later for debugging, especially
                    during long term maintenance:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -c populate_sdk <replaceable>image</replaceable>
                    </literallayout></para>

                    <para>Alternatively, you can build the minimal
                    toolchain components that match the target.
                    Doing so creates a smaller than typical SDK and only
                    contains a minimal set of components with which to
                    build simple test applications, as well as run the
                    debugger:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake meta-toolchain
                    </literallayout></para>

                    <para>A final method is to build Gdb itself within
                    the build system:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake gdb-cross-<replaceable>architecture</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    Doing so produces a temporary copy of
                    <filename>cross-gdb</filename> you can use for
                    debugging during development.
                    While this is the quickest approach, the two previous
                    methods in this step are better when considering
                    long-term maintenance strategies.
                    <note>
                        If you run
                        <filename>bitbake gdb-cross</filename>, the
                        OpenEmbedded build system suggests the actual

                        The suggestion is usually the actual name you want

                    <para>In many cases, during development you want a
                    quick method to deploy a new binary to the target and
                    debug it, without waiting for a full image build.
                    </para>

                    <para>One approach to solving this situation is to
                    just build the component you want to debug.
                    Once you have built the component, copy the
                    executable directly to both the target and the
                    host <filename>debugfs</filename>.</para>

                    <para>If the binary is processed through the debug
                    splitting in OpenEmbedded, you should also
                    copy the debug items (i.e. <filename>.debug</filename>
                    contents and corresponding
                    <filename>/usr/src/debug</filename> files)
                    from the work directory.
                    Here is an example:

        <title>Debugging with the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) on the Target</title>

        <para>
            The previous section addressed using GDB remotely for debugging
            purposes, which is the most usual case due to the inherent
            hardware limitations on many embedded devices.
            However, debugging in the target hardware itself is also possible
            with more powerful devices.
            This section describes what you need to do in order to support
            using GDB to debug on the target hardware.
        </para>

        <para>
            To support this kind of debugging, you need do the following:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>
                    Ensure that GDB is on the target.
                    You can do this by adding "gdb" to
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'><filename>IMAGE_INSTALL</filename></ulink>:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " gdb"
                    </literallayout>
                    Alternatively, you can add "tools-debug" to
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></ulink>:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_FEATURES_append = " tools-debug"

                    </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>
                    Ensure that debug symbols are present.
                    You can make sure these symbols are present by installing
                    <filename>-dbg</filename>:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " <replaceable>packagename</replaceable>-dbg"
                    </literallayout>
                    Alternatively, you can do the following to include all the
                    debug symbols:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_FEATURES_append = " dbg-pkgs"
                    </literallayout>
                    </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <note>
                To improve the debug information accuracy, you can reduce the
                level of optimization used by the compiler.
                For example, when adding the following line to your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file, you will reduce
                optimization from
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-FULL_OPTIMIZATION'><filename>FULL_OPTIMIZATION</filename></ulink>
                of "-O2" to
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEBUG_OPTIMIZATION'><filename>DEBUG_OPTIMIZATION</filename></ulink>
                of "-O -fno-omit-frame-pointer":
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DEBUG_BUILD = "1"
                </literallayout>
                Consider that this will reduce the application's performance
                and is recommended only for debugging purposes.

        <title>Debugging Parallel Make Races</title>

        <para>
            A parallel <filename>make</filename> race occurs when the build
            consists of several parts that are run simultaneously and
            a situation occurs when the output or result of one
            part is not ready for use with a different part of the build that
            depends on that output.
            Parallel make races are annoying and can sometimes be difficult
            to reproduce and fix.
            However, some simple tips and tricks exist that can help
            you debug and fix them.
            This section presents a real-world example of an error encountered
            on the Yocto Project autobuilder and the process used to fix it.
            <note>
                If you cannot properly fix a <filename>make</filename> race
                condition, you can work around it by clearing either the

                Because race conditions are intermittent, they do not
                manifest themselves every time you do the build.
                In fact, most times the build will complete without problems
                even though the potential race condition exists.

                In this example, compiling the "neard" package is causing the
                problem.
                So the first thing to do is build "neard" locally.
                Before you start the build, set the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PARALLEL_MAKE'><filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename></ulink>
                variable in your <filename>local.conf</filename> file to
                a high number (e.g. "-j 20").
                Using a high value for <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename>
                increases the chances of the race condition showing up:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake neard
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Once the local build for "neard" completes, start a
                <filename>devshell</filename> build:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake neard -c devshell
                </literallayout>
                For information on how to use a
                <filename>devshell</filename>, see the
                "<link linkend='platdev-appdev-devshell'>Using a Development Shell</link>"
                section.
            </para>

            <para>
                In the <filename>devshell</filename>, do the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ make clean
     $ make tools/snep-send.o
                </literallayout>
                The <filename>devshell</filename> commands cause the failure
                to clearly be visible.
                In this case, a missing dependency exists for the "neard"
                Makefile target.
                Here is some abbreviated, sample output with the
                missing dependency clearly visible at the end:

            <para>
                Because there is a missing dependency for the Makefile
                target, you need to patch the
                <filename>Makefile.am</filename> file, which is generated
                from <filename>Makefile.in</filename>.
                You can use Quilt to create the patch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ quilt new parallelmake.patch
     Patch patches/parallelmake.patch is now on top
     $ quilt add Makefile.am
     File Makefile.am added to patch patches/parallelmake.patch
                </literallayout>
                For more information on using Quilt, see the
                "<link linkend='using-a-quilt-workflow'>Using Quilt in Your Workflow</link>"
                section.
            </para>

            <para>
                At this point you need to make the edits to
                <filename>Makefile.am</filename> to add the missing
                dependency.
                For our example, you have to add the following line
                to the file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     tools/snep-send.$(OBJEXT): include/near/dbus.h
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Once you have edited the file, use the
                <filename>refresh</filename> command to create the patch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ quilt refresh
     Refreshed patch patches/parallelmake.patch
                </literallayout>
                Once the patch file exists, you need to add it back to the
                originating recipe folder.
                Here is an example assuming a top-level
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
                named <filename>poky</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cp patches/parallelmake.patch poky/meta/recipes-connectivity/neard/neard

                The final thing you need to do to implement the fix in the
                build is to update the "neard" recipe (i.e.
                <filename>neard-0.14.bb</filename>) so that the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                statement includes the patch file.
                The recipe file is in the folder above the patch.
                Here is what the edited <filename>SRC_URI</filename>
                statement would look like:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI = "${KERNELORG_MIRROR}/linux/network/nfc/${BPN}-${PV}.tar.xz \
                file://neard.in \
                file://neard.service.in \
                file://parallelmake.patch \
               "
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                With the patch complete and moved to the correct folder and
                the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement updated, you can
                exit the <filename>devshell</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ exit
                </literallayout>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='testing-the-build'>
            <title>Testing the Build</title>

            <para>
                With everything in place, you can get back to trying the
                build again locally:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake neard
                </literallayout>
                This build should succeed.
            </para>

            <para>
                Now you can open up a <filename>devshell</filename> again
                and repeat the clean and make operations as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake neard -c devshell
     $ make clean
     $ make tools/snep-send.o
                </literallayout>
                The build should work without issue.
            </para>

            <para>
                As with all solved problems, if they originated upstream, you
                need to submit the fix for the recipe in OE-Core and upstream
                so that the problem is taken care of at its source.
                See the
                "<link linkend='how-to-submit-a-change'>Submitting a Change to the Yocto Project</link>"

        <title>Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle</title>

        <para>
            One of the concerns for a development organization using open source
            software is how to maintain compliance with various open source
            licensing during the lifecycle of the product.
            While this section does not provide legal advice or
            comprehensively cover all scenarios, it does
            present methods that you can use to
            assist you in meeting the compliance requirements during a software
            release.
        </para>

        <para>
            With hundreds of different open source licenses that the Yocto
            Project tracks, it is difficult to know the requirements of each
            and every license.
            However, the requirements of the major FLOSS licenses can begin
            to be covered by
            assuming that three main areas of concern exist:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Source code must be provided.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>License text for the software must be
                    provided.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Compilation scripts and modifications to the
                    source code must be provided.
                    </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            There are other requirements beyond the scope of these
            three and the methods described in this section
            (e.g. the mechanism through which source code is distributed).
        </para>

        <para>
            As different organizations have different methods of complying with
            open source licensing, this section is not meant to imply that
            there is only one single way to meet your compliance obligations,
            but rather to describe one method of achieving compliance.
            The remainder of this section describes methods supported to meet the
            previously mentioned three requirements.
            Once you take steps to meet these requirements,
            and prior to releasing images, sources, and the build system,
            you should audit all artifacts to ensure completeness.
            <note>
                The Yocto Project generates a license manifest during
                image creation that is located
                in <filename>${DEPLOY_DIR}/licenses/<replaceable>image_name-datestamp</replaceable></filename>
                to assist with any audits.
            </note>
        </para>

        <section id='providing-the-source-code'>
            <title>Providing the Source Code</title>

            <para>
                Compliance activities should begin before you generate the
                final image.
                The first thing you should look at is the requirement that
                tops the list for most compliance groups - providing
                the source.
                The Yocto Project has a few ways of meeting this
                requirement.
            </para>

            <para>
                One of the easiest ways to meet this requirement is
                to provide the entire
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>
                used by the build.
                This method, however, has a few issues.
                The most obvious is the size of the directory since it includes
                all sources used in the build and not just the source used in
                the released image.
                It will include toolchain source, and other artifacts, which
                you would not generally release.
                However, the more serious issue for most companies is accidental
                release of proprietary software.
                The Yocto Project provides an
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-archiver'><filename>archiver</filename></ulink>
                class to help avoid some of these concerns.
            </para>

            <para>
                Before you employ <filename>DL_DIR</filename> or the
                <filename>archiver</filename> class, you need to decide how
                you choose to provide source.
                The source <filename>archiver</filename> class can generate
                tarballs and SRPMs and can create them with various levels of
                compliance in mind.
            </para>

            <para>
                One way of doing this (but certainly not the only way) is to
                release just the source as a tarball.
                You can do this by adding the following to the
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file found in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     INHERIT += "archiver"
     ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "original"
                </literallayout>
                During the creation of your image, the source from all
                recipes that deploy packages to the image is placed within
                subdirectories of
                <filename>DEPLOY_DIR/sources</filename> based on the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE'><filename>LICENSE</filename></ulink>
                for each recipe.
                Releasing the entire directory enables you to comply with
                requirements concerning providing the unmodified source.
                It is important to note that the size of the directory can
                get large.
            </para>

            <para>
                A way to help mitigate the size issue is to only release
                tarballs for licenses that require the release of
                source.
                Let us assume you are only concerned with GPL code as
                identified by running the following script:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # Script to archive a subset of packages matching specific license(s)
     # Source and license files are copied into sub folders of package folder
     # Must be run from build folder
     #!/bin/bash
     src_release_dir="source-release"
     mkdir -p $src_release_dir
     for a in tmp/deploy/sources/*; do
        for d in $a/*; do
           # Get package name from path
           p=`basename $d`
           p=${p%-*}
           p=${p%-*}
           # Only archive GPL packages (update *GPL* regex for your license check)
           numfiles=`ls tmp/deploy/licenses/$p/*GPL* 2> /dev/null | wc -l`
           if [ $numfiles -gt 1 ]; then
              echo Archiving $p
              mkdir -p $src_release_dir/$p/source
              cp $d/* $src_release_dir/$p/source 2> /dev/null
              mkdir -p $src_release_dir/$p/license
              cp tmp/deploy/licenses/$p/* $src_release_dir/$p/license 2> /dev/null
           fi
        done
     done                </literallayout>
                At this point, you could create a tarball from the
                <filename>gpl_source_release</filename> directory and
                provide that to the end user.
                This method would be a step toward achieving compliance
                with section 3a of GPLv2 and with section 6 of GPLv3.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='providing-license-text'>
            <title>Providing License Text</title>

            <para>
                One requirement that is often overlooked is inclusion
                of license text.
                This requirement also needs to be dealt with prior to
                generating the final image.
                Some licenses require the license text to accompany
                the binary.
                You can achieve this by adding the following to your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     COPY_LIC_MANIFEST = "1"
     COPY_LIC_DIRS = "1"
     LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE = "1"
                </literallayout>
                Adding these statements to the configuration file ensures
                that the licenses collected during package generation
                are included on your image.
                <note>
                    <para>Setting all three variables to "1" results in the
                    image having two copies of the same license file.
                    One copy resides in
                    <filename>/usr/share/common-licenses</filename> and
                    the other resides in
                    <filename>/usr/share/license</filename>.</para>

                    <para>The reason for this behavior is because
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-COPY_LIC_DIRS'><filename>COPY_LIC_DIRS</filename></ulink>
                    and
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-COPY_LIC_MANIFEST'><filename>COPY_LIC_MANIFEST</filename></ulink>
                    add a copy of the license when the image is built but do
                    not offer a path for adding licenses for newly installed
                    packages to an image.
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE'><filename>LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE</filename></ulink>
                    adds a separate package and an upgrade path for adding
                    licenses to an image.</para>
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                As the source <filename>archiver</filename> class has already
                archived the original
                unmodified source that contains the license files,
                you would have already met the requirements for inclusion
                of the license information with source as defined by the GPL
                and other open source licenses.

            <para>
                By releasing the version of the OpenEmbedded build system
                and the layers used during the build, you will be providing both
                compilation scripts and the source code modifications in one
                step.

                If the deployment team has a
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-layers'>BSP layer</ulink>
                and a distro layer, and those those layers are used to patch,
                compile, package, or modify (in any way) any open source
                software included in your released images, you
                might be required to release those layers under section 3 of
                GPLv2 or section 1 of GPLv3.
                One way of doing that is with a clean
                checkout of the version of the Yocto Project and layers used
                during your build.
                Here is an example:

     # We built using the release_branch for our layers
     $ git clone -b release_branch git://git.mycompany.com/meta-my-bsp-layer
     $ git clone -b release_branch git://git.mycompany.com/meta-my-software-layer
     # clean up the .git repos

                One thing a development organization might want to consider
                for end-user convenience is to modify
                <filename>meta-poky/conf/bblayers.conf.sample</filename> to
                ensure that when the end user utilizes the released build
                system to build an image, the development organization's
                layers are included in the <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>
                file automatically:

        <para>
            The error reporting tool allows you to
            submit errors encountered during builds to a central database.
            Outside of the build environment, you can use a web interface to
            browse errors, view statistics, and query for errors.
            The tool works using a client-server system where the client
            portion is integrated with the installed Yocto Project
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>
            (e.g. <filename>poky</filename>).

        <para>
            A live instance of the error reporting server exists at

            or send an email to the mailing list.
            <note>
                If you send error reports to this server, the reports become

                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                By default, the error reporting feature stores information in
                <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LOG_DIR'><filename>LOG_DIR</filename></ulink><filename>}/error-report</filename>.
                However, you can specify a directory to use by adding the following
                to your <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ERR_REPORT_DIR = "path"
                </literallayout>
                Enabling error reporting causes the build process to collect
                the errors and store them in a file as previously described.
                When the build system encounters an error, it includes a
                command as part of the console output.
                You can run the command to send the error file to the server.
                For example, the following command sends the errors to an
                upstream server:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ send-error-report /home/brandusa/project/poky/build/tmp/log/error-report/error_report_201403141617.txt
                </literallayout>
                In the previous example, the errors are sent to a public
                database available at
                <ulink url='http://errors.yoctoproject.org'></ulink>, which is
                used by the entire community.
                If you specify a particular server, you can send the errors
                to a different database.
                Use the following command for more information on available
                options:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ send-error-report --help
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                When sending the error file, you are prompted to review the
                data being sent as well as to provide a name and optional
                email address.
                Once you satisfy these prompts, the command returns a link
                from the server that corresponds to your entry in the database.
                For example, here is a typical link:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     http://errors.yoctoproject.org/Errors/Details/9522/
                </literallayout>
                Following the link takes you to a web interface where you can
                browse, query the errors, and view statistics.
