This test data is used to verify the 'cooker' module of the layerindex.

The module consists of a faux project bblayers.conf with four layers defined.

layer1 - openembedded-core
layer2 - networking-layer
layer3 - meta-python
layer4 - openembedded-layer (meta-oe)

Since we do not have a fully populated cooker, we use this to test the
basic index generation, and not any deep recipe based contents.
