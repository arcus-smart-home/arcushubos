Subject: [PATCH] OptionsGTK.cmake: drop the hardcoded introspection/gtkdoc
 disabling when cross-compiling

This was not possible to override from the command line and in OpenEmbedded
(one of the most prominent cross-compilation frameworks) introspection does work fine,
through the use of qemu target emulation.
