Subject: [PATCH] Don't use getentropy() on Linux

Issue #29188: Support glibc 2.24 on Linux: don't use getentropy() function but
read from /dev/urandom to get random bytes, for example in os.urandom().  On
Linux, getentropy() is implemented which getrandom() is blocking mode, whereas
os.urandom() should not block.

(cherry picked from commit 2687486756721e39164fa9f597e468c35d495227)
