Subject: [PATCH] Fix hanging issue in _XReply

Assume event queue is empty if another thread is blocking waiting for event.

If one thread was blocking waiting for an event and another thread sent a
reply to the X server, both threads got blocked until an event was
received.

Upstream-Status: Submitted [https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/171458/]

This patch needs to be removed once the corresponding patch has been merged upstream.
