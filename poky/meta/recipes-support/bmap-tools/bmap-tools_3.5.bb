SUMMARY = "Tools to generate block map (AKA bmap) and flash images using bmap"
DESCRIPTION = "Bmap-tools - tools to generate block map (AKA bmap) and flash images using \
bmap. Bmaptool is a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap) for a file, \
and copying files using the block map. The idea is that large file containing \
unused blocks, like raw system image files, can be copied or flashed a lot \
faster with bmaptool than with traditional tools like "dd" or "cp"."
