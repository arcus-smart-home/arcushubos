Subject: [PATCH] remove the test to convert euc-jp

Remove the test "Test against HP-UX 11.11 bug:
No converter from EUC-JP to UTF-8 is provided"
since we don't support HP-UX and if the euc-jp is not
installed on the host, libunistring will be built without
iconv support and will cause guild-native configure fail.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE specific]
