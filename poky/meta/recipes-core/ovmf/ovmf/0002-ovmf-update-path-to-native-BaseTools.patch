Subject: [PATCH] ovmf: update path to native BaseTools

BaseTools is a set of utilities to build EDK-based firmware. These utilities
are used during the build process. Thus, they need to be built natively.
When cross-compiling, we need to provide a path to the location of these
tools. The BBAKE_EDK_TOOLS_PATH string is used as a pattern to be replaced
with the appropriate location before building.
