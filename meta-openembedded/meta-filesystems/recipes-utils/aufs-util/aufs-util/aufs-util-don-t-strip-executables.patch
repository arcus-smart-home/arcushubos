Subject: [PATCH] aufs-util: don't strip executables

By default, aufs-util strips its binaries. This produces QA warnings
as follows:

   WARNING: File '/sbin/mount.aufs' from aufs-util was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
   WARNING: File '/sbin/auplink' from aufs-util was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
   WARNING: File '/sbin/umount.aufs' from aufs-util was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
   WARNING: File '/sbin/auibusy' from aufs-util was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
   WARNING: File '/usr/lib/libau.so.2.6' from aufs-util was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!

To prevent this, we remove -s from LDFLAGS.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe specific]
