Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH 1/1] setup.py: remove the setup_requires for
 setuptools-scm

The setup_requires argument forces the download of the egg file for setuptools-scm
during the do_compile phase.  This download is incompatible with the typical fetch
and mirror structure.  The only usage of scm is the generation of the _version.py
file and in the release tarball it is already correctly created

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe specific]
