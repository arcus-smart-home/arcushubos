Subject: [PATCH] CMake build: Force shared libs with unsuffixed names
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For windows build sake CMake complains when a project wants to build shared and
static libraries with same name. This caused the authors of fltk to generate
libraries with names suffixed by '_SHARED' when building fltk with cmake -
autotools builds do not suffix.

Reasons to build shared libs with correct names:

* Shared libraries are the preferred choice for embedded devices
* There are projects (e.g yoshimi) expecting shared libraries with unsuffixed
  names - as created by autotools build. These projects link against static
  libraries by accident causing unusable binaries.
