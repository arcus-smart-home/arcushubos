# MCUboot

## Overview

MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs.   The goal of MCUboot is to
define a common infrastructure for the bootloader, system flash layout on
microcontroller systems, and to provide a secure bootloader that enables
easy software upgrade.

MCUboot is operating system and hardware independent, and relies on
hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with.  Currently
MCUboot works with both the Apache Mynewt, and Zephyr operating systems, but
more ports are planned in the future. RIOT is currently supported as a boot
target with a complete port planned.

  - [Mynewt](readme-mynewt.md)
  - [RIOT](readme-riot.md)
- [Patch submission](SubmittingPatches.md) for information
  on how to contribute to mcuboot.
- Testing
