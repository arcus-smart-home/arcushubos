This is mcuboot, version 1.1.0

MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs.   The goal of MCUboot is to
define a common infrastructure for the bootloader, system flash layout on
microcontroller systems, and to provide a secure bootloader that enables
easy software upgrade.

MCUboot is operating system and hardware independent, and relies on
hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with.  Currently
mcuboot works with both the Apache Mynewt, and Zephyr operating systems, but
more ports are planned in the future. RIOT is currently supported as a boot
target with a complete port planned.

## Using MCUboot

Instructions for different operating systems can be found here:
- [Zephyr](docs/readme-zephyr.md)
- [Mynewt](docs/readme-mynewt.md)
- [RIOT](docs/readme-riot.md)

## Roadmap

The issues being planned and worked on are tracked on Jira. To participate

For more information in the source, here are some pointers:

- [boot/bootutil](boot/bootutil): The core of the bootloader itself.
- [boot/boot\_serial](boot/boot_serial): Support for serial upgrade within the bootloader itself.
- [boot/zephyr](boot/zephyr): Port of the bootloader to Zephyr
- [boot/mynewt](boot/mynewt): Mynewt bootloader app
- [imgtool](scripts/imgtool.py): A tool to securely sign firmware images for booting by mcuboot.
- [sim](sim): A bootloader simulator for testing and regression
