Atmel WINC1500 HAL
##################

Origin:
   Extracted from Atmel ASF - Advanced Software Framework
   Embedded Software Solution for Atmel Flash MCUs

   Took the generic winc1500 code in ASF directory:
   common/components/wifi/winc1500

   http://asf.atmel.com/docs/latest/download.html

Status:
   3.35

Purpose:
   Drive Atmel WINC1500 offloaded WiFi chip.

Description:
   In order to support WINC1500 chip, it has been decided to use the
   existing Atmel't HAL: ASF. WINC1500 is an MCU providing WiFi and
   an IPv4 stack. These features appear then fully offloaded from Zephyr
   into that chip.

   Provides an acces to WiFi networks.

   Zephyr does not own a native WiFi stack, however enabling Zephyr to
   access WiFi networks is critical and using such offloaded MCU is the
   easiest way to achieve this goal.

   WINC1500 is fairly easy to interface with, it proposes either SPI or
   IÂ²C bus to do so.

Dependencies:
   None.

   No direct dependancy. Zephyr will see the MCU as a usual network
   interface. Such object being instanciated by the driver, which in turn
   accesses the chip through Atmel ASF HAL.
