This directory contains different HALs for SoCs supported by Zephyr.

The following HALs are supported:

atmel
-------
The Atmel Software Framework (ASF) provides device header files and peripheral
drivers for Atmel SoCs.

cmsis
-------
The ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) defines a
set of standard interfaces to ARM Cortex-M SoCs.

libmetal
--------
libmetal provides a HAL abstraction layer utilized by open-amp

gecko
-----
The Silicon Labs Gecko SDK provides device header files and peripheral drivers
for all Silicon Labs Gecko devices: EFM32, EZR32 and EFR32.

mcux
-------
The NXP MCUXpresso Software Development Kit (MCUX) provides device header files
and peripheral drivers for Kinetis, LPC, and i.MX SoCs.

nordic
-------
The Nordic Semiconductor Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK) provides device
header files for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 SoCs.

qmsi
-------
Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller Software Interface (QMSI) is a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) for Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller products. It
currently support the following SoCs:

- Intel® Quark™ D2000 Microcontroller
- Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller

stm32cube
---------
ST Microelectronics STM32Cube SDK
Provides CMSIS header files and two different porting layers HAL (hardware
abstraction layer), and LL (low layers) enabling portability between different
STM32 devices via standardized API calls.
LL and HAL provide different level of porting on STM32 SoCs. They could be used
independently, or mixed depending on the needs.

ti
-------
Texas Instruments SimpleLink SDKs provide peripheral and WiFi driver libraries
for the SimpleLink family of SoCs.
