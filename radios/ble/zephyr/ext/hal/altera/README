Altera HAL
#####################

Origin:
   Altera Quartus Prime Lite SDK
   http://dl.altera.com/?edition=lite

Status:
   v17.0

Purpose:
   Hardware Abstraction Layer for NIOSII based soft IP blocks.

Description:
   Altera Hardware Abstraction Layer(or Altera HAL) provides the
   low level driver support for NIOSII based soft IP blocks.

   Altera HAL primarily abstracts the low level hardware interactions
   of different NIOSII based soft IP blocks like UART, I2C, SPI etc...
   and provides the high level API's for the shim drivers.

Dependencies:
   Some of the Altera HAL drivers have dependency on the newlibc and
   it needs to be enabled before enabling the Altera HAL.

   The NIOSII port of Zephyr will be accessing the Altera HAL through
   shim drivers to enable the different soft IP blocks on Zephyr.
