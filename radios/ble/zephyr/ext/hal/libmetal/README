   When we import libmetal we removed the tests/ and examples/ dir to reduce
   the amount of code imported.

Purpose:
   HAL abstraction layer used by open-amp

Description:
   Libmetal provides common user APIs to access devices, handle device
   interrupts and request memory across the following operating environments:

   * Linux user space (based on UIO and VFIO support in the kernel)
   * RTOS (with and without virtual memory)
   * Bare-metal environments

Dependencies:
   Depends on Zephyr itself as it utilizes Zephyr's APIs to provide an
   abstraction to open-amp.
