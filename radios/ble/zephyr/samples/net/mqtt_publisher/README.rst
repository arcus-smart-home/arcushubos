MQTT Publisher
##############

Overview
********

`MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`_ (MQ Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight
publish/subscribe messaging protocol optimized for small sensors and
mobile devices.

The Zephyr MQTT Publisher sample application is a MQTT v3.1.1
client that sends MQTT PUBLISH messages to a MQTT broker.
See the `MQTT V3.1.1 spec`_ for more information.

.. _MQTT V3.1.1 spec: http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html

The source code of this sample application can be found at:
:file:`samples/net/mqtt_publisher`.

Requirements
************

- Linux machine
- Freedom Board (FRDM-K64F)
- Mosquitto server: any version that supports MQTT v3.1.1. This sample
  was tested with mosquitto 1.3.4.
- Mosquitto subscriber
- LAN for testing purposes (Ethernet)

Build and Running
*****************

Currently, this sample application only supports static IP addresses.
Open the :file:`src/config.h` file and set the IP addresses according
to the LAN environment.
Alternatively, set the IP addresses in the :file:`prj_frdm_k64f.conf` file.

This file :file:`src/config.h` also contains some variables that may be changed:

MQTT broker TCP port:

.. code-block:: c

	#define SERVER_PORT		1883

Application sleep time:

.. code-block:: c

	#define APP_SLEEP_MSECS		500

Application RX and TX timeout:

.. code-block:: c

	#define APP_TX_RX_TIMEOUT       300

Max number of connection tries:

.. code-block:: c

	#define APP_CONNECT_TRIES	10

Max number of MQTT PUBLISH iterations:

.. code-block:: c

	#define APP_MAX_ITERATIONS	5

MQTT Client Identifier:

.. code-block:: c

	#define MQTT_CLIENTID		"zephyr_publisher"

This sample application supports the IBM Bluemix Watson topic format that can
be enabled by changing the default value of APP_BLUEMIX_TOPIC from 0 to 1:

.. code-block:: c

	#define APP_BLUEMIX_TOPIC	1

The Bluemix topic may include some parameters like device type, device
identifier, event type and message format. This application uses the
following macros to specify those values:

.. code-block:: c

	#define BLUEMIX_DEVTYPE		"sensor"
	#define BLUEMIX_DEVID		"carbon"
	#define BLUEMIX_EVENT		"status"
	#define BLUEMIX_FORMAT		"json"

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source code
of this sample application (i.e. :file:`samples/net/mqtt_publisher`) and type:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/net/mqtt_publisher
   :board: frdm_k64f
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

Open another terminal window and type:

.. code-block:: console

	$ sudo mosquitto -v -p 1883

Open another terminal window and type:

.. code-block:: console

	$ mosquitto_sub -t sensors

	Bye!

The line:

.. code-block:: console

	[try_to_connect:220] mqtt_connect: -5 <ERROR>

means that an error was detected and a new connect message will be sent.

The MQTT API is asynchronous, so messages are displayed as the callbacks are
executed.

This is the information that the subscriber will receive:

.. code-block:: console

	$ mosquitto_sub -t sensors
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS0
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS1
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS2
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS0
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS1
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS2
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS0
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS1
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS2
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS0
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS1
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS2
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS0
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS1
	DOORS:OPEN_QoS2

This is the output from the MQTT broker:
