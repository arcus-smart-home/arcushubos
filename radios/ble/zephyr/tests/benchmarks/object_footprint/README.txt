Title: Object Footprint Measurement

Description:
This sample builds multiple kernels with different configurations
starting with a minimal kernel that basically does nothing and
adds features one by one to measure the minimal footprint for the
various supported kernel objects and features.

Usage:

Execute ./run.sh which will build all configurations and will create
a text file with the footprint results for each configuration.
