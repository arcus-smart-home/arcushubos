This is the test app which test ADC on Quark SE processor.

Default ADC mode is interrupt mode.
The case tests ADC working in different resolutions.

The analog input pin and channel number mapping
for Quark Se Devboard.
A0 Channel 10
A1 Channel 11
A2 Channel 12
A3 Channel 13
A4 Channel 14

This test uses channel 10 to sample the voltage of VCC3.3.
So connect A0 to VCC3.3 and start the APP.
