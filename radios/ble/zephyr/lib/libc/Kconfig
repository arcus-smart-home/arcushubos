config NEWLIB_LIBC
	bool
	prompt "Build with newlib c library"
	help
	  Build with newlib library. The newlib library is expected to be
	  part of the SDK in this case.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_ALIGNED_HEAP_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Newlib aligned heap size"
	depends on MPU_REQUIRES_POWER_OF_TWO_ALIGNMENT
	depends on NEWLIB_LIBC
	depends on USERSPACE
	default 0
	help
	  If user mode is enabled, and MPU hardware has requirements that
	  regions be sized to a power of two and aligned to their size,
	  and user mode threads need to access this heap, then this is necessary
	  to properly define an MPU region for the heap.

	  If this is left at 0, then remaining system RAM will be used for this
	  area and it may not be possible to program it as an MPU region.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF
	bool "Build with newlib float printf"
	default n
	depends on NEWLIB_LIBC
	help
	  Build with floating point printf enabled. This will increase the size of
	  the image.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_SCANF
	bool "Build with newlib float scanf"
	default n
	depends on NEWLIB_LIBC
	help
	  Build with floating point scanf enabled. This will increase the size of
	  the image.

config STDOUT_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Send stdout to console"
	depends on CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	default y if NEWLIB_LIBC
	help
	  This option directs standard output (e.g. printf) to the console
	  device, rather than suppressing it entirely. See also EARLY_CONSOLE
	  option.
