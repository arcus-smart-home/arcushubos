inherits:
  - !include other.yaml # or [other1.yaml, other2.yaml]
# other.yaml contains bindings that also apply to this node.
# In case there are duplicate definitions in the different
# bindings the one that is defined first prevails.

< parent | child >:
# parent/child is used to document implicit relation between nodes.
# This information is required to generate parent related bits in child
# attributes.
# In case parent has 'bus', slave inherits some information from master.
# parent and child should share same bus-type value.
   bus: <bus-type>

# properties will be the contents of the device tree node
# property names must match the property names in the DT

properties:

# A typical property entry will look like the following
#   <name of property as it is in device tree>
#     category: <required | optional>
#     type: <string | int | array>
#     description: <description of property>
#     generation: <define | structure>

# At a minimum, the compatible is required for matching nodes
    compatible: <list of string compatible matches>
      category: required
      type: string

# reg is used to denote mmio registers
    reg:
      type: array
      description: mmio register space
      generation: define
      category: required

# interrupts specifies the interrupts that the driver may utilize
    interrupts:
      type: array
      category: required
      description: required interrupts
      generation: define

# If a node is a interrupt controller, gpio controller, pinmux device
# or any device which is referenced via phandle plus some number of cells
# then the cell fiels below must be present.

"#cells":
  - cell0    # name of first cell
  - cell1    # name of second cell
  - cell2    # name of third cell
  - and so on and so forth
