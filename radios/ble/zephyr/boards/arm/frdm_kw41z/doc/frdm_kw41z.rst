NXP FRDM-KW41Z
##############

Overview
********

The FRDM-KW41Z is a development kit enabled by the Kinetis |reg| W series
KW41Z/31Z/21Z (KW41Z) family built on ARM |reg| Cortex |reg|-M0+ processor with
integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth |reg| Smart/Bluetooth
|reg| Low Energy
(BLE) v4.2, Generic FSK, IEEE |reg| 802.15.4 and Thread.

The FRDM-KW41Z kit contains two Freedom boards that can be used as a
development board or a shield to connect to a host processor. The FRDM-KW41Z is
form-factor compatible with the Arduino |trade| R3 pin layout for more expansion
options.

The FRDM-KW41Z highly-sensitive, optimized 2.4 GHz radio features a PCB
F-antenna which can be bypassed to test via SMA connection, multiple power
supply options, push/capacitive touch buttons, switches, LEDs and integrated
sensors.

System Clock
============

The KW41Z SoC is configured to use the 32 MHz external oscillator on the board
with the on-chip FLL to generate a 40 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The KW41Z SoC has one UART, which is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The FRDM-KW41Z includes the :ref:`nxp_opensda` serial and debug adapter built
into the board to provide debugging, flash programming, and serial
communication over USB.

To use the pyOCD tools with OpenSDA, follow the instructions in the
:ref:`nxp_opensda_pyocd` page using the `DAPLink FRDM-KW41Z Firmware`_. The
pyOCD tools are not the default for this board, therefore it is necessary to
set ``OPENSDA_FW=daplink`` explicitly when using the default flash and debug
mechanisms.

.. note::
   pyOCD added support for KW41Z after support for this board was added to
   Zephyr, so you may need to build pyOCD from source based on the current
   master branch (f21d43d).

To use the Segger J-Link tools with OpenSDA, follow the instructions in the
:ref:`nxp_opensda_jlink` page using the `Segger J-Link OpenSDA V2.1 Firmware`_.
The Segger J-Link tools are the default for this board, therefore it is not
necessary to set ``OPENSDA_FW=jlink`` explicitly in the environment before
programming and debugging.

With these mechanisms, applications for the ``frdm_kw41z`` board
configuration can be built and debugged in the usual way (see
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more
details).

Flashing
========

The Segger J-Link firmware does not support command line flashing, therefore
the usual ``flash`` build system target is not supported.

Debugging
=========

This example uses the :ref:`hello_world` sample with the
:ref:`nxp_opensda_jlink` tools. Run the following to build
your Zephyr application, invoke the J-Link GDB server, attach a GDB client, and
program your Zephyr application to flash. It will leave you at a gdb prompt.
