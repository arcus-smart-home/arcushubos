Origin:

   [Provide a link to the source]

Status:
   [Current version of this component, supported by Zephyr]

Purpose:
   [Brief description of what this software does]

Description:
   [Long description that will help reviewers discuss suitability of the
   package to solve the problem at hand (there may be a better package
   available.)

   What is its primary functionality (e.g., SQLLite is a lightweight
   database)?

   What problem are you trying to solve? (e.g., a state store is
   required to maintain ...)

   Why is this the right package to solve it (e.g., SQLite is small,
   easy to use, and has a very liberal license.)]

Dependencies:
   [What other components does this package depend on? Does the software
   include any dynamic or static linking, or automatic downloading of any
   code?

   Will the Zephyr project have a direct dependency on the component, or
   will it be included via an abstraction layer with this component as a
   replacable implementation?]
