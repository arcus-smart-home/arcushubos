# Automatically set PACKAGE_ARCH for MACHINE_SOCARCH
#
# This allow to easy reuse of binary packages among similar SoCs. The
# usual use for this is to share SoC specific packages among different
# boards.
#
# MACHINE_SOCARCH_FILTER list all packages associated with
# MACHINE_SOCARCH and, when match, will set PACKAGE_ARCH as MACHINE_SOCARCH
#
# MACHINE_ARCH_FILTER list all packages associated with
# MACHINE_ARCH and, when match, will set PACKAGE_ARCH as MACHINE_ARCH
#
# For example, in meta-fsl-arm, this is used to share GPU packages for
# i.MX53 boards (as all them share the AMD GPU) and i.MX6 based boards
# (as all them share Vivante GPU).
#
# To use the class, specify, for example:
#
# MACHINE_SOCARCH_SUFFIX_soc = "-soc"
#
# and the need filters, as:
#
# MACHINE_ARCH_FILTER = "virtual/kernel"
# MACHINE_SOCARCH_FILTER_soc = "virtual/libgles1 ... virtual/libgl"
