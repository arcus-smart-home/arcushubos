Subject: [PATCH] include <sys/sysmacros.h> for major/minor defintions

glibc 2.25 is warning about it if applications depend on
sys/types.h for these macros, it expects to be included
from <sys/sysmacros.h>

Fixes
| Grow.c:3534:13: error: In the GNU C Library, "minor" is defined
|  by <sys/sysmacros.h>. For historical compatibility, it is
|  currently defined by <sys/types.h> as well, but we plan to
|  remove this soon. To use "minor", include <sys/sysmacros.h>
|  directly. If you did not intend to use a system-defined macro
|  "minor", you should undefine it after including <sys/types.h>. [-Werror]
| Query.c: In function 'Query':
| Query.c:105:13: error: In the GNU C Library, "makedev" is defined
